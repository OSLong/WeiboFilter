As for the parents, they need to go to the city officials and ask for their understanding and if they can get replacement animals. Some towns are allowing poultry as people have come to rely on the fresh eggs coming from a known source. In this case a possible case could be made that the child could be allowed replacement poultry given his needs as an autistic child. It would be very hard for the parents to explain to any child such a senseless act, and given his special needs just about impossible. It is up to the parents to do what they must with the help of people who understand the needs of this child. If the parents get the okay to get poultry again they must do everything possible to insure the chickens etc are females, no crowing roosters, and that they keep the pens clean and away from neighboring homes. A huge concern of city officials are the noise and smell of chickens that are not kept in clean pens and are allowed to fly, which can be curtailed with wing clipping. I do hope there can be a good solution, but wonder if it wouldn't be better to look into a therapy dog, which seems like a better choice than poultry, which no matter how clean, can carry diseases. just a thought.',1

'Tata Motors.\r\n? What will the Oil Companies do to stop it?\r\n It is an auto engine that runs on air. That's right; air not gas or diesel or electric but just the air around ... us. Take a look.\r\n Tata Motors of India has scheduled the Air Car to hit Indian streets by August 2012\r\n The Air Car, developed by ex-Formula One engineer Guy N. For Luxembourg-based MDI, uses compressed air to pu**** engine's pistons and make the car go.\r\n The Air Car, called the "Mini CAT" could cost around 365,757 rupees in India or $8,177 US.\r\n The Mini CAT which is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis, a body of fiberglass that is glued not welded and powered by compressed air. A Microprocessor is used to control all electrical functions of the car. One tiny radio transmitter sends instructions to the lights, turn signals and every other electrical device on the car. Which are not many.\r\n The temperature of the clean air expelled by the exhaust pipe is between 0-15 degrees below zero, which makes it suitable for use by the internal air conditioning system with no need for gases or loss of power.\r\n There are no keys, just an access card which can be read by the car from your pocket. According to the designers, it costs less than 50 rupees (approx. $1.12 US) per 100 KM, that's about a tenth the cost of a car running on gas. It's mileage is about double that of the most advanced electric car, a factor which makes it a perfect choice for city motorists. The car has a top speed of 105 KM per hour or 60 mph and would have a range of around 300 km or 185 miles between refuels. Refilling the car will take place at adapted gas stations with special air compressors. A fill up will only take two to three minutes and costs approximately 100 rupees and the car will be ready to go another 300 kilometers.\r\n This car can also be filled at home with it's on board compressor. It will take 3-4 hours to refill the tank, but it can be done while you sleep. \r\n Because there is no combustion engine, changing the 1 liter of vegetable oil is only necessary every 50,000 KM or 30,000 miles. Due to its simplicity, there is very little maintenance to be done on this car.\r\n This Air Car almost sounds too good to be true. We'll see in August. 2012',1

'Isn't prostitution already legal in Vegas?? Tax it like any other service, implement health inspections, and it becomes a winning situation for all concerned. Here are just some of the immediate benefits to legalized prostitution:? Better control of STDs (savings is less hospital space being used for treatment), keeping that many out of our overwhelmed jails and prisons (very costly), putting some (not all) pimps out of business, and the government makes money.? maybe it won't yield a profit, but the money generated could be used for other purposes.\r\n?\r\nIt won't eradicate the illegal side completely, but it could make a big difference.? Prostitution, legal or not, will never just go away, so instead of our government only spending money on trying to?arrest, prosecute, and punish, at?the very least the savings will be from not using other government resources.',1

While their question addresses the issue of divorce, Jesus answers them with his interpretation of God's design for marriage �C one man and one woman for life," said Lenow.\r\n"In verses 4-6, Jesus responds, 'Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.' In this passage, Jesus affirms that God created male and female and that marriage is designed between one man and one woman ...

My fat, lazy spaniel was on the porch next door rushed over and started fighting with the dog and I was able to get away from him biting me.? I have a large scar on my leg still to this day, age 63 now.? So when someone says their dog won't bite you, don't believe them.? A dog is a dog, pedigree or mixed and under the right circumstances will bite you?or anyone else.',1
'If you make 250K to?500K you'll pay more under Obama or Romney.? If you make millions or billions you'll pay almost nothing under Romney.\r\n?\r\nUnder , Mitt Romney wouldn��t pay any taxes for the next ten years �� or any of the years after that. Now, do I know that that��s true. Yes, I��m certain. Well, maybe not quite nothing. In 2010 �� the only year we have seen a from him �� Romney would have paid an effective tax rate of around 0.82 percent under the Ryan plan, rather than the he actually did. How would someone with more than $21 million in taxable income pay so little? Well, the vast majority of Romney��s income came from capital gains, interest, and dividends. And Ryan wants to eliminate all taxes on capital gains, interest and dividends. Romney, of course, when Newt Gingrich proposed it back in January by pointing out that zeroing out taxes on savings and investment would mean zeroing out his own taxes.  Almost. Romney did earn $593,996 in author and speaking fees in 2010 that would still be taxed under the Ryan plan. Just not much. Ryan would cut the top marginal tax rate from 35 to 25 percent and get rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax �� saving Romney another $292,389 or so on his 2010 tax bill. Now, Romney would still owe self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees, but that only amounts to $29,151. Add it all up, and Romney would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, for a cool effective rate of 0.82 percent. But what about corporate taxes? Aren��t they a double tax on savings and investment, so Romney��s ��real�� rate is higher than his headline rate? No. As of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has pointed out, Romney has structured his investments as ��pass-throughs�� that avoid corporate tax. In other words, the 0.82 percent tax rate is really a 0.82 percent tax rate. It might seem impossible to fund the government when the super-rich pay no taxes. That is accurate. Ryan would actually raise taxes on the bottom 30 percent of earners, according to the nonpartisan , but that hardly fills the revenue hole he would create. The solution? All but eliminate all government outside of Social Security and defense �� a point my colleague has made in incredible chart form.  Maybe that Romney didn��t pay taxes for a decade was really a time-traveler from the future. If Romney wins, it could very well be true.',1

'DM,\r\n\r\n I am very intrigued by your post. A few weeks ago I read one and thought it was a standalone comment, but now realize you have been doing this for months. As a counselor this brings me great concern which I would like to talk with you about offline, if possible.\r\n \r\n Please let me explain, often people become upset by routes in life that don��t work out. Venting and warning others is useful. This is healthy and good. Where it becomes insalubrious is when the intensity of blaming others or a corporation cultivates into obsessed anger while personal responsibility is not accepted. \r\n \r\n Furthermore, blaming an inanimate corporation shows displacement and guilt which is often associated to emotional matters. When you vent continually about hiring the wrong broker it leads me to believe something much larger is at your core. +70 posts start to solidify this premonition. Please understand my feelings are sympathetic. Just be careful that you lashing out doesn��t manifest into an adjustment disorder. \r\n \r\n While it is common to need months or even years to feel normal after adjusting to life situations and events (i.e. loss of spouse, divorce, health concern) personal attributes can also stall the healing process. i.e. Poor or negative self-image becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consider a spouse who becomes frustrated enough to leave after dealing with their partners personality weaknesses for numerous years. \r\n \r\n So, if you are turning to technology as an outlet to reclaim control please be very careful. Especially, if the problems you are dealing with in the physical world are not getting adequate attention. \r\n \r\n Feel free to let me know if you are interested in talking further. \r\n \r\n Luke',1

'I have to agree with most of what they said about Thailand. Rent is indeed very reasonable there and the food is dirt cheap and very tasty. The medical care is also very good and cost a fraction of what it does here in the USA. Still, with rent of only $400 a month I��m not sure why this Larry guy needs nearly $2000 a month to live in Chiang Mai unless he��s spending $1000 a month on women. Also it should be pointed out that these places are becoming less and less of a deal every day as the US dollar get weaker and weaker. The first time I went to Thailand about 15 years ago I could get about 44 Baht per US dollar, but the last time I lived there I only got about 30 Baht for that same dollar. Also, for people like me who prefer to live in Phuket and be near the beach things are much more expensive than in Chiang Mai. Still if I were not such a beach lover I would definitely choose Chiang Mai as its cooler, cheaper, less humid, and has perhaps the best food in all of Thailand.',1

He must think we are ALL stupid, but obviously, only some of us are.\r\n?\r\nAnd as for you, FACEINTHECROWD, Cubans have BUILT Miami and a lot of Florida, not to mention many other parts of the country.

As results from such research accumulated, professionals in medicine, mental health, and the behavioral and social sciences reached the conclusion that it was inaccurate to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions based on once-prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples comprising patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system. \r\nIn recognition of the scientific evidence,?the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973, stating that "homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities."

The devil has the Christian world so distracted by this issue that most people are not focusing on themselves and their own sins. We have gotten into the big sin - little sin syndrome. Jesus, during his ministry on earth gave us an example as to how He looks at and deals with sin and sinners.? In John 8:1-11, the story of woman caught in adultery shows us how WE are to deal with sin �C we focus on our own. It was Jesus who said, ��He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.��? Homosexuality is not the ��big�� sin �C it is a sin.?? So is shacking-up, stealing, lying, not loving one other, disobedience to parents, drinking, smoking, and many other sins.? Homosexuality is not the sin that��s going to bring the wrath of God on our nations �C it is SIN PERIOD.? Then there��s the argument �C God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of homosexual sin - Well the flip side of that argument is �C And He destroyed a whole world (all but 8 people) with a flood because of SIN. ?And I quote, ��And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.? And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.? And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth.�� Genesis 6: 5-7. ?We all have our own homosexual sins �C it��s just not called homosexuality.? My Bible tells me that adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.��? Galatians 5:19-21. God gives every man and woman the power of choice.? Jesus loves all us sinners, but He hates the sins we all commit.

Should we return to the time of the witch hunts?, when the church became so strong that it sent out it's authorities to hunt down, torcher and kill anyone who was not in compliance with the church. That is why this country has a seperation of church and state clause. Just as christians have a right to believe the way they want to; as Americans, those who choce not to believe, have that right also. If christians are extended special privleges, more or different rights than non-christains, then the constitution has been violated. We end up with a mixture of church and state.',1

I (and I��m sure many others) knew it was coming eventually. I thank you for not disappointing everyone, but I am surprise it took 2 complete replies before it popped up......... That is pretty much the number one of those liberal ��go-to lines�� I mentioned earlier. I must say that I am really a little disappointed though, because you didn't call me a racist... I thought that was part of the protocol. After all, it is obvious I am in favor of the right of a citizen having tools...oh sorry...'weapons��..t  ? hus meaning I am not of the common liberal mind-set which seems to be to get rid of them all (although, in their defense, I know plenty of common sense people who call themselves liberals yet still believe in the right to bear arms)....and as you have pointed out, anyone who is of these beliefs is a ��redneck hillbilly�� ...and it goes on and on down the line until I��m nothing but a stupid, uneducated, racist pig....oh, I left out bible thumper. As I originally said, I wrote the post for ��amusement�� ...and I was actually enjoying the exchange, but it obviously got under your skin as proven by the childish banter you spewed in your closing remarks. You actually started out with an impressive retort, for what it was, but you had to lower yourself with your closing remark.',1

I say we go back to the old days where kids actually got an education and discipline that helps them reach their full potential when they become adults? Has anyone noticed how stuipid kids are?now days when they leave high school? If you dont know what Im talking about ask one a question about our history. THEY DONT KNOW. so how does their vote mean anything? They cant even tell you who?takes over when the president and vice president steps down for whatever reason. My generation could not leave the 6th grade without knowing all seats and current holders in congress. Ask our great graduates what the strips in our flag mean.

'#Rhet15, Funny you should mention Coleman Yooung. He would have never gotten elected if it wasn't for the fact that the Detroit Police had a bad but proven habit of kicking Blacks?butts on a daily basis and?running back to their suburbs each night to brag about their exploits. I don't make any excuse of anyone Black or White who don't take care of their belongins or take pride in thier surroundings. But I do take exception with all this anti-black hate that is pouring out on these pages! If you think that all Black people are lazy and on welfare, you're seriously mistaken. Most welfare recepients are white, but that's not well publicized. It's easier to blame those you HATE. Detroit is hurting for many reasons and the major one is not the color of the inhabitants. You see the real issue is funds, not the funds you give to folks, but the funds that grow businesses. If there are no jobs on industry, then the city will die and it is doing now. The businesses are all owned by the minority majority. If you don't like the way things are going, just starve the city and wait, it will soon die and you can then retrun to take over. I will agree that there is a mentality in Detroit that is deeply rooted in the 70s and it needs to change. We as Blacks now determine our own destiney and some of us are doing a piss poor job. Some of the readers here are right in saying we need to take responsibility for our own shortcomings, and we have not! But simply being Black is not the cause, but a easy target for those who need it to further their cause.',1

'@ Q-Z-Sue: A human being is a human being whether or not he/she has taken their first breath. By aborting you are robbing the child's future..of LIFE. How can you say a baby is just an embryo..haven't you seen pictures of late abortions?? Those pictures are very clear that the baby is not just a cluster of cells but a tiny developed human being that should have the chance to live..and make their own decisions in life. Like for example the decision to live. Once a woman is pregnant their is a another human life within her whether you believe so or not. Also it shouldn't be just up to the woman to make a decision on her abortion. It takes two to procreate and the father should have some say. In the end its not just her baby its his too. A baby receives half DNA from both parents so you can't just say the baby is the woman's only and she should have all of the say.',1

They have made it clear they are more interested in boosting the careers of fading artists than in discovering and promoting new talent. They have made it clear they will never fix a voting system that can be manipulated by organized voting blocks, thus skewing the results to give us winners who are neither the most talented nor the most popular contestants. They also seem to have little interest in effectively promoting the careers of those contestants they sign to recording contracts after the show. After 12 seasons only two winners have gone on to major recording success, along with some non-winners who number is so small they can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The most recent of those, Adam Lambert was the runner up on Season 8, so that means the last four seasons have produced no major recording artists. The judging panel for the upcoming season 13 seems more like a desperate flail th****gitimate effort to make the show about finding and cultivating talent again.

'MYTH # 4\r\n LGBT people don't live nearly as long as heterosexuals. \r\nTHE ARGUMENT\r\n Anti-gay organizations want to promote heterosexuality as the healthier "choice." Furthermore, the purportedly shorter life spans and poorer physical and mental health of gays and lesbians are often offered as reasons why they shouldn't be allowed to adopt or foster children. \r\nTHE FACTS\r\n This falsehood can be traced directly to the discredited research of Paul Cameron and his , specifically a 1994 paper he co-wrote entitled, "The Lifespan of Homosexuals." Using obituaries collected from gay newspapers, he and his two co-authors concluded that gay men died, on average, at 43, compared to an average life expectancy at the time of around 73 for all U.S. men. On the basis of the same obituaries, Cameron also claimed that gay men are 18 times more likely to die in car accidents than heterosexuals, 22 times more likely to die of heart attacks than whites, and 11 times more likely than blacks to die of the same cause. He also concluded that lesbians are 487 times more likely to die of murder, suicide, or accidents than straight women. \r\nRemarkably, these claims have become staples of the anti-gay right and have frequently made their way into far more mainstream venues. For example, William Bennett, education secretary under President Reagan, used Cameron's statistics in a 1997 interview he gave to ABC News' "This Week." \r\nHowever, like virtually all of his "research," Cameron's methodology is egregiously flawed �� most obviously because the sample he selected (the data from the obits) was not remotely statistically representative of the LGBT population as a whole. Even Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has called Cameron's methods "just ridiculous',1

'MYTH # 8\r\n Gay people are more prone to be mentally ill and to abuse drugs and alcohol. \r\nTHE ARGUMENT\r\n Anti-gay groups want not only to depict sexual orientation as something that can be changed but also to show that heterosexuality is the most desirable "choice" �� even if religious arguments are set aside. The most frequently used secular argument made by anti-gay groups in that regard is that homosexuality is inherently unhealthy, both mentally and physically. As a result, most anti-gay rights groups reject the 1973 decision by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. Some of these groups, including the particularly hard-line , claim that "homosexual activists" managed to infiltrate the APA in order to sway its decision. \r\nTHE FACTS\r\n All major professional mental health organizations are on record as stating that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. \r\nIt is true that LGBT people suffer higher rates of anxiety, depression, and depression-related illnesses and behaviors like alcohol and drug abuse than the general population. But studies done during the past 15 years have determined that it is the stress of being a member of a minority group in an often-hostile society �� and not LGBT identity itself �� that accounts for the higher levels of mental illness and drug use. \r\nRichard J. Wolitski, an expert on minority status and public health issues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, put it like this in 2008: "Economic disadvantage, stigma, and discrimination ... increase stress and diminish the ability of individuals [in minority groups] to cope with stress, which in turn contribute to poor physical and mental health."',1

The expression was documented as being in wide usage in the 1920s, but may have originated much earlier.\r\n\r\n"Shucking and jiving" was a tactic of both survival and resistance. A slave, for instance, could say eagerly, "Oh, yes, Master," and have no real intention to obey. Or an African-American man could pretend to be working hard at a task he was ordered to do, but might put up this pretense only when under observation. Both would be instances of "doin' the old shuck 'n jive."\r\n\r\nIt has been adopted into non-Afroamerican speech, with a reference to behavior adopted in order to avoid criticism.  ?

As for the parents, they need to go to the city officials and ask for their understanding and if they can get replacement animals. Some towns are allowing poultry as people have come to rely on the fresh eggs coming from a known source. In this case a possible case could be made that the child could be allowed replacement poultry given his needs as an autistic child. It would be very hard for the parents to explain to any child such a senseless act, and given his special needs just about impossible. It is up to the parents to do what they must with the help of people who understand the needs of this child. If the parents get the okay to get poultry again they must do everything possible to insure the chickens etc are females, no crowing roosters, and that they keep the pens clean and away from neighboring homes. A huge concern of city officials are the noise and smell of chickens that are not kept in clean pens and are allowed to fly, which can be curtailed with wing clipping. I do hope there can be a good solution, but wonder if it wouldn't be better to look into a therapy dog, which seems like a better choice than poultry, which no matter how clean, can carry diseases. just a thought.',1

'Tata Motors.\r\n? What will the Oil Companies do to stop it?\r\n It is an auto engine that runs on air. That's right; air not gas or diesel or electric but just the air around ... us. Take a look.\r\n Tata Motors of India has scheduled the Air Car to hit Indian streets by August 2012\r\n The Air Car, developed by ex-Formula One engineer Guy N. For Luxembourg-based MDI, uses compressed air to pu**** engine's pistons and make the car go.\r\n The Air Car, called the "Mini CAT" could cost around 365,757 rupees in India or $8,177 US.\r\n The Mini CAT which is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis, a body of fiberglass that is glued not welded and powered by compressed air. A Microprocessor is used to control all electrical functions of the car. One tiny radio transmitter sends instructions to the lights, turn signals and every other electrical device on the car. Which are not many.\r\n The temperature of the clean air expelled by the exhaust pipe is between 0-15 degrees below zero, which makes it suitable for use by the internal air conditioning system with no need for gases or loss of power.\r\n There are no keys, just an access card which can be read by the car from your pocket. According to the designers, it costs less than 50 rupees (approx. $1.12 US) per 100 KM, that's about a tenth the cost of a car running on gas. It's mileage is about double that of the most advanced electric car, a factor which makes it a perfect choice for city motorists. The car has a top speed of 105 KM per hour or 60 mph and would have a range of around 300 km or 185 miles between refuels. Refilling the car will take place at adapted gas stations with special air compressors. A fill up will only take two to three minutes and costs approximately 100 rupees and the car will be ready to go another 300 kilometers.\r\n This car can also be filled at home with it's on board compressor. It will take 3-4 hours to refill the tank, but it can be done while you sleep. \r\n Because there is no combustion engine, changing the 1 liter of vegetable oil is only necessary every 50,000 KM or 30,000 miles. Due to its simplicity, there is very little maintenance to be done on this car.\r\n This Air Car almost sounds too good to be true. We'll see in August. 2012',1

It could start out small, with maybe one office (neitehr city, state nor county) were assigned per county to watch and ticket violating officers, that would eliminated the 'brotherhood' squabbles that would result from ending the professional couttersy.?

'Two things about Jesus Christ and God are absolutely clear:\r\n\r\n1.  They are both against "modern slavery".\r\n\r\n2.  God and Jesus Christ are against any type of pedophilia, homosexuality, bestiality, and incest.  In fact The Holy Bible States absolutely and without doubt that if you engage in any of these sins, without repenting and turning from these evils you will burn in Hell for eternity!  Homosexuality is such an especially evil sin that The Holy Bible calls it a personal attack upon God and in The Holy Bible homosexuality is called an 'ABOMINATION" to God.  Sin doesn't get any more evil or destructive than that!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nSo don't allow fake preachers lie to you about God, this is what God said about homosexuality:\r\n\r\n""Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor HOMOSEXUALS, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God." \r\n\r\nThe Holy Bible goes on to say that homosexuals will become of a depraved mind, and no matter how many times you try and explain to them how evil and destructive homosexuality is, they will not listen to God, and all they will want to do is engage in the evil and destructive sin of homosexuality, kind of like a crack head, that only wants to smoke crack!  Homosexuality is an evil and destructive sin, if you engage in it you will burn in HELL for eternity!!!  This is the word of GOD!!!!!',0

'How sad. I shook my head when the news of their relationship, and marriage aired on television. I knew that the marriage was doomed from the beginning. Granted, the cougar lifestyle seemed appealing in the beginning, but I knew that someone at some point would have a change of heart. RT is right, Demi is a great woman, but she made a very bad choice in her personal life. I think them getting married was totally unnecessary, and here we are looking at the end result. She's older, more mature, and I am convinced that she thought that having Ashton around her arm would be great publicity for her, and make her feel young again. I'm sure it worked at first, but this is the consequence of being with a younger person. Bruce Willis is married to a young tenderoni, and I get the feeling that that reality is going to hurt his marriage later down the road. I hope she's able to bounce back from this, and be with someone who can complete her, and be there for her the way a younger man can't. Besides, Ashton is young and is almost making more money than she ever did. If I were Demi, that would be a threat to me, and yo **** got to go :-)',0

'Hey everyone, go check out Joe2013's profile.  There is a VERY obvious pattern to his posts.  He has about a 50 to 1 ratio of posting on articles that deal with... you guessed it!  HOMOSEXUALITY.  I've even noticed the tendency to take an article that has nothing remotely to do with homosexuality, and manage to start a diatribe on them about "the immoral, evil, and destructive sin of homosexuality".  Seems to me that this guy is awfully hung up on the topic? Also, I've noticed a regrettable tendency to use language that I would not expect to see/hear from someone who claims to be so "Godly". F*** with the asterisks is still F***. Calling someone a "retard" when God clearly would be offended on behalf of his beautiful children who are born with Down's Syndrome or some other such handicap.

'Two things about Jesus Christ and God are absolutely clear:\r\n\r\n1.  They are both against "modern slavery".\r\n\r\n2.  God and Jesus Christ are against any type of pedophilia, homosexuality, bestiality, and incest.  In fact The Holy Bible States absolutely and without doubt that if you engage in any of these sins, without repenting and turning from these evils you will burn in Hell for eternity!  Homosexuality is such an especially evil sin that The Holy Bible calls it a personal attack upon God and in The Holy Bible homosexuality is called an 'ABOMINATION" to God.  Sin doesn't get any more evil or destructive than that!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nSo don't lake fake preachers lie to you about God, this is what God said about homosexuality:\r\n\r\n""Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

'Two things about Jesus Christ and God are absolutely clear:\r\n\r\n1.  They are both against "modern slavery".\r\n\r\n2.  God and Jesus Christ are against any type of pedophilia, homosexuality, bestiality, and incest.  In fact The Holy Bible States absolutely and without doubt that if you engage in any of these sins, without repenting and turning from these evils you will burn in Hell for eternity!  Homosexuality is such an especially evil sin that The Holy Bible calls it a personal attack upon God and in The Holy Bible homosexuality is called an 'ABOMINATION" to God.  Sin doesn't get any more evil or destructive than that!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nSo don't allow fake preachers lie to you about God, this is what God said about homosexuality:\r\n\r\n""Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor HOMOSEXUALS, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God." \r\n\r\nThe Holy Bible goes on to say that homosexuals will become of a depraved mind, and no matter how many times you try and explain to them how evil and destructive homosexuality is, they will not listen to God, and all they will want to do is engage in the evil and destructive sin of homosexuality, kind of like a crack head, that only wants to smoke crack!  Homosexuality is an evil and destructive sin, if you engage in it you will burn in HELL for eternity!!!  This is the word of GOD!!!!!',0

'What Jasmin said is not true about homosexuality but this is............\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an extremely high rate of parasitic and other intestinal infections documented among male homosexual practitioners because of oral-**** contact. In fact, there are so many infections that a syndrome called "the Gay Bowel" is described in the medical literature.33 "Gay bowel syndrome constitutes a group of conditions that occur among persons who practice unprotected **** intercourse, anilingus, or fellatio following **** intercourse."34 Although some women have been diagnosed with some of the gastrointestinal infections associated with "gay bowel," the vast preponderance of patients with these conditions are men who have sex with men.35 \r\n"Rimming" is the street name given to oralanal contact. It is because of this practice that intestinal parasites ordinarily found in the tropics are encountered in the bodies of American gay men. Combined with **** intercourse and other homosexual practices, "rimming" provides a rich opportunity for a variety of infections. Men who have sex with men account for the lion's share of the increasing number of cases in America of sexually transmitted infections that are not generally spread through sexual contact.',0
