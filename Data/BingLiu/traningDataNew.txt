'looking only at eliminating the mortgage interest deduction without revising the entire tax code and budget to restore an equitible share to all taxpayers, is ludicrous. this deduction is the major one for the middle class, which mr. obama and mr. romney both claim they wish to preserve. the fact that 40 of wage earners don\'t pay any income tax should also be reviewed. all other deductions designed to encourage certain social, economic, or political behaviors also need to be justified. "the power to tax, is the power to destroy." beyond tax reform, the federal budget must also be reworked to eliminate useless and failed programs like, but notlimited to, the war on drugs, no child left behind, foreign aid to countries that hate us, the afghanistan war in a country that history has proven, will never be democratic or have a strong central government, encouraging alternatives to fossil fuels, federal pensions  health care why should they be different from from social security  medicare, etc., etc. our founding fathers did not trust a overly strong central government and wrote a constitution to limit its powers. judicial decisions have given us a new "balance of powers".',1

'dan from mv ca got it. the author of the article didn\'t say lower interest rates caused an increase in housing payments, he said it led to increases in home prices. when you make something cheaper to begin with i.e. lower interest means lower costs of borrowing then this leads to an increase in demand which in turn eventually increases the price. interest rates aren\'t the only thing that effects housing prices of course, but whenever you lower the cost of something people tend to want more of it until the demand gets so big the prices rise. same is true in reverse when people have to spend too much for something they eventually cut back, demand drops, prices drop. it\'s a cycle.thus, monetary policy affects more than just how much money your bank pays you when you save money or how much your credit card rate is. it affects everyone with the manipulation of the housing markets and sending false signals. i\'ve been in banking since 2001 and the rates continue to reach "historic lows" no matter how much crap hits the fan. raising r',1

'i am well below the middle income group, but i have yet to understand the term "fair share" when it comes to taxes. perhaps you are too young to realize that when the government is allowed to determine what is fair, then it also has the ability to change what is fair, in other words, maybe it isn\'t fair for that the ones making over 1,000,000 dollars a year don\'t pay enough in taxes now, but what if the government decides that a person making only 500,000 a year isn\'t paying their fair share what about when the government decides that because i make 35,000 a year my fair share should be much more than the person who makes, oh say, 34,000 a year, just where do you think the magical line should be the government sets the rules, enforces the rules on whom they desire, and will always pander to those who will vote them back in.  again we can always make villians of the rich, but when the poor outnumber the rich, then the poor get to determine who is rich.

'it is time to face reality. we now communicate and pass data around the globe easier than people passed data around the block 15 years ago. unlike in prior decades, we are now in a world where the us needs to compete for companies to operate here. instead of competing, us policy has been to criticize or threaten companies that that outsource. companies that don\'t control costs and maximize their opportunities find themselves out of business! call it greed if you want, but over the long term it is survival. in my view, the conversation needs to be about corporate tax rates, special tax deals and dividends tax rates. the us corporate tax rate is the highest in the industrial world. lower it to 15. at the same time, eliminate all the special tax deals and tax dividends as ordinary income. typically, large corporations evaluate projects based on the after tax return to the corporation. this tax change will provide a suitable rate of return for many more projects and encourage corporations to reinvest their earnings here as opposed to distributing the earnings to their shareholders. corporations that are have or are considering overseas projects will be much more likely to ',1

'in school, one of my economics courses presented a view of the financial strata in our country that was more granular than the3 classeswe typically see. basically, it broke each of the major classes upper, middle, lower into 3 sub classes, also named upper, middle and lower. hence, you ended up with 9 classes, not 3. at the top end was the upperupperclass, and at the bottom was the lowerlowerclass. in the middle classwe have uppermiddle, middlemiddle and lowermiddle. looking at itthis way, yes, you could say, as both obama and romney have said, the middle class range does go up to 250k and probably starts around 35k. i think you could agree that being inthe uppermiddleclass is significantly different than being in the lowermiddleclass 250k vs. 35k, or, bmw vs. used chevy. in the latter case, you may find yourself not too far from falling into the lower class or below the poverty line. perhaps it would be more helpful if our economic information was presented to using these 9 classes, not just 3. of course, using 9 classes may prove to be too much for the mental capacity of many in this country, using just 3 classes seems to be doing that already.',1
