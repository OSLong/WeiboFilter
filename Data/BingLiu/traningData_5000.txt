'worst feeling in the world for mitt romney is knowing that no matter what you do or say between now and the election it is already over and you are going to lose. he will be known as the last republican who could have held the white house because for the next 35 years the white house will be controlled by the democrats and their modern progressive approach. don\'t worry about mitt. now he doesn\'t have to close all those foreign bank accounts. however, all those constitutional amendments he was planning in order to destroy our separation of church and state will now never happen and the mormon church will lose a fortune in tax abatements. is it a church or a business empire with a global reach it\'s a freakin\' business and it needs to be taxed. show me a minister who doesn\'t have a big house and a mercedes and i will show you a dreamer. vote obama so our kids can learn how to read and write, compete on a global scale and not have to live in a trailer. thank god we won\'t have lyin\' ryan for a vp. thank god romney won\'t be in there to start wwiii with his racist and slanderous rhetoric. this is the end of the bush depression. both bushes. no more pointless holy war. no more bailouts fo',1

'stay the course, your article is on the right track. so the textbook response to recession is buy into it and hold until recovery, but anyone with half a brain could see there is more happening this time. we have seen massive job terminations and a sell-off of assets and aspects to foreign interests who also import what we lost. that\'s not recession, it\'s terrorism. the incredible growth in the markets since is predicated on gw bush redesigning the currency so he could authorize more of it and raised the debt ceiling repeatedly to accommodate it. simply, instead of using the additional dollars to restructure the dynamics of main street, banks- including financial houses that are now banks- invested all that cash overseas. i have no clue what pocketprotector and the other pickle juice drinkers are talking about in the comments below mine. there are indeed at least 8 ways the markets are artificially inflated and a threat to national stability. we have no main street right now and will be forced to replace workers in the workforce (like a time out swap of talent) to create the type of revenues needed to cover the interest on what we owe. job \'creation\' won\'t cut it. since we realized',1
