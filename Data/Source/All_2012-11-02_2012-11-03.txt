I am so glad to see that there are so many Americans who are and have been seeing the light!  I have been screaming "We need to do another Boston Tea Party before it is too late" for the last 20 years but everyone just laughed at me - we have no rights any longer - the government controls us - just open your eyes - it is the very wealthy that is manipulating the market - and every candidate, president, and politician are bought off or in it for themselves!  My daughter asked me which candidate I would vote for - I told her "NONE - I WOULD WRITE IN ON THE BALLOT - WE THE PEOPLE AND MARK THAT ONE"!  Romney is not going to be any better - so which choice is the worst of the two evils?!  And it has been that way for a very long time now!

For those approaching retirement, our salaries at age 31 were a fraction of what yours is.  I think I made around $11,000 a year 33 years ago and that was a pretty good salary.  Saving 15% of that was about $1650 a year.  It didn't add up as fast years ago when salaries were not as inflated as they are now.  Meg8681, you are a very lucky person to have such a well-paying job at your age.  I didn't start making $40,000 until about 5 or 6 years ago and I'm STILL making $40,000 a year.

I am not a fan of the old school Union model, they need to clean house, work closely with industry to train and provide a competent work force that can evolve with business \r\nThe real issue is that Unions have not evolved to address a new business model. Workers without out some protection will be exploited. That is just the way it is. Business demands cheap labor, and for many companies labor is a commodity not an asset. Just look at the folks building your ipads in China. They had to put nets outsite the windows because the workers would rather die that be forced to work in such an environment - the eco system there is basically a modern version of indentured servitude.

In spite of being reported that the story is not factual, you union haters still believe it to be true.  In part, because it was on FOX.  \r\n \r\nThe union doesn't have to force non-unionized workers away.  In fact, in many cases, after working alongside union workers during situations like these, the non union workers seek to organize once they get home.\r\n \r\nThis is a ploy for the election in an attempt to make sure someone is angry at someone else in order to force the outcome of the election.

When women go into domestic abuse shelters, the shelter provides two very key components; shelter and therapy.  Your friend needed therapy as much as she needed shelter.  Until you understand the dynamic of her life, you will never get it or understand it.  It might be very black and white to you, but you were obviously raised in an environment of no abuse.  No one ever hit me when I was a little kid, but I was sexual abused by a lot of men and older boy’s.  When I grew up “I had very bad taste in men“.  I was so use to being abused, I very unconsciously, picked men that abused me.  I got hit because I did not “mind” and would not “listen”.  I really did think it was all my fault!!!!  It just played into everything I had been “taught” as a kid; I just simply did not know anything else.  Therapy is the only thing that can make you understand the dynamics of it all.  Even today at 56 years old, I could very easily relapse into old patterns if I do not very consciously watch my triggers.  No, you do not understand and you need to walk in the shoes of your friends life.

How about the restaurant starts paying for their employees? Yeah, that sounds good. I hate this system of shaming people for not tipping. Employees should be paid by their employer and tips should be those special occasions when someone provides exceptionally good service and is appreciated enough by the customer that the customer wants to reward that person for it.

Most stunning to me is when NYC needs help, it's people are hurting badly living through an unimaginable nightmare, Mayor Bloomburg holds rather than postpone a marathon that steels much needed resources from people with no electricity and then when he needs support from Americans across the country he uses this nightmare as an opportunity to make divisive and scurrilous political statements. This was not a time for the Mayor of NYC to divide by endorsing Barack Obama and side with Michael Moore on left wing Global Warming interpretations. These actions when his city needs unity and leadership are reprehensible. He could learn a lesson from Rudy.

Relationship failures after marriage or living together after having children are horrible.  People loose half of their stuff because they were together.  If you have children together you have responsbilities.  Marriage provides you with a legal framework to work on living together doesn't. \r\n  \r\nMy nephew thinks that he is protecting his children by no marrying their mother.  His girlfiend and he have now split.  From the children's point of view marriage or now marriage, it is the same.  Because they weren't married, they are actually less protected unless everyone goes to court anyway.

Did you not read my post? I clearly stated first I would prevent a women from hitting me. If she was persistent or hit me in the nuts it's fare game and she would hit the floor. Believe me I've seen men just sit there and take it and that's not what I'm saying. Violence is for the weak minded who cannot control their emotions. A smart person knows how to avoid it in the first place. Women or man everyone has the right to defend themselves. Some however choose to do it with something other than violence in return.

More right-wing, made-up news to demonize unions.  Take a misunderstanding and turn it into a slanted piece bashing the union.  Before you trolls get your panties in a bunch, read the whole story: there is no indication that anyone was turned away from working based on not belonging to a union, period.

YOU should read more than MSLSD. Try reading the ACTUAL story that led to Berr getting his panties in a wad and running off to write a rebuttal. His REBUTTAL IS INACCURATE, if not outright dishonest. Try reading the REAL story. \r\nEDUCATE YOURSELF.\r\n \r\n"The general manager of Decatur Utilities, Ray Hardin, told Friday morning they were presented at a staging area in Virginia. The documents stated they had to affiliate with a union to work, which the crews would not agree to.  \r\nHardin said the crews were not turned away, but were made to believe that affiliating with the union was a requirement to work.  \r\n"It was and remains our understanding that agreeing to those requirements was a condition of being allowed to work in those areas," said Hardin."

Bill,\r\n \r\nI have read and enjoyed your articles for amost a decade now.  Your three game scenario has played out like a Baseball Clinic.  Just wonderding if there will actually be a forth game no one wants to even think about.  It is the game in which all hard-working Americans in their 30-50's reach retirement and like you stated above about unfunded liabilities, their pensions, 401Ks, and other retirement investments must be recognized and paid.  Only the numbers on their statements are bogus and there is no money to speak of.  Just a thought.

In my neck of the woods most of our city officers and the majority of our county Sherriff's deputies are grossly overweight, some even obese. And they don't seem to care much about their appearance, ie; trousers too short, shirts half tucked in, gut protruding from beneath ballistic vest and rolling over duty belt. City PD officers are permitted to wear "BDU's" and "skull caps". (Talk about looking ridiculous) Conversely, our state troopers are much more professional in manner, physique and uniform. \r\n I agree. Not all our "pigs". But polite, professional and lenient officers are fewer and farther between than they used to be.  \r\n  \r\n Message recieved. Please excuse my tardy response. ;) \r\n Hope all is well with you and you're family.

Rising Waters, I do agree!  But, I ain'ts one of them solving the problems.  I asked a state representative a simple question a few weeks back pertaining to percentages of a state allotment that went to different categories.  He voted on the legislation but he couldn't tell me the percentages.  He said it would be determined by the federal government.  I asked him "then, what good is state government?"  He couldn't answer that either but he assured me we needed it!!!  So, it ain't me smart enough to solve them there problems, brother!!!

Quoted text: \r\n"Apparently IRN, you missed the insult about us Toyota and Honda owners all having boring, bland vehicles. Yes, an insult is the same as an attack." \r\n  \r\nThere was no insult in the original comment.  Simply a statement that non enthusiasts don't understand why car lovers love their cars. No insult and no attack. \r\n  \r\nQuoted text: \r\n"Maybe zquz doesn't realize that many of us do not NEED our cars to provide us with entertainment and fun, we have REAL FUN toys that do that for us, like boats, motorcycles, ATV's and snowmobiles." \r\n  \r\nAnd if I said that people who need to toys like boats, motorcycles, ATV's and snowmobiles to have fun lacked personality I would sound just as ignorant as your earlier comment.

The unions in NJ could care less about the storm damage. All they want is a captured audience of people that will need construction repair done for months to come and they want to make sure everyone is paying them their normal union wages of $121.12 per hour for skilled labor. Then the Alabama guys come along and will work for lower wages to help the millions of people who need power and construction repairs....they are not allowed to work in New Jersey!! Unions win....the citizens of NJ lose. And Obama said he would cut through the RED TAPE....looks like he failed again!!

I agree the real rate is likely 22% and even higher for 55+, but is that really due to age discrimination?  Or is it due to employers do whatever they can to get by in this economy?  Paying kids (20-30 year olds) pennies on the dollar compared to what the 55+ crowd requires/expects just might be the difference in their survival.

You're right, Upgreyed, I don't have kids.  Never wanted any, never had any, and do not, and will never, regret that decision.  Nearly everyone I talk to that has kids wishes they hadn't, or at least had fewer of them.  Unless you have a high income, the quickest way to the poor house is children.  Even if you can afford them, they likely will eventually turn on you or move in on you with THEIR kids someday.  There used to be some stupid societal shame in not having children, but not any more.  In some circles, choosing to remain childless is admirable.  There are too many people on the planet already, and too many kids are neglected or abused.  Reproduction is biological.  All animals reproduce, but that doesn't make them decent or deserving parents.

Because we sign our names over and over (practice makes perfect), and because we also tend to be conscious of how our signature looks and/or how it comes across to others, most people's signature is actually a slight variation of their handwriting.  It wouldn't be at all uncommon for a signature to be a bit more formal looking than the scrawled note it's attached to.  I'm not saying you're wrong to question the story... I'm just saying, because of this, it's not thoroughly damning evidence.\r\n \r\nBut, of course, you could be right.  It could be a fake.  In fact, I kind of hope it is.  I hate to think of someone being that (fill in the blank) that they would have a $140 meal in a restaurant, without tipping.  LOL

The party system is what is killing us as George Washington predicted as is our fake fiat monetary system. Your current worth is an xo in a bank account worth less everyday. It has nothing to do with who is in power. We created 800 billion out of thin air to finance the current bubble. Enjoy it while you can. The dollar erodes daily. No point in even saving it anymore. I've seen 20 percent inflation at the pump and in food prices in the last year or so. This is mainly where average folks spend their income. You can expect a lot more of it. When the economy collapses in a couple years it won't matter if your rich, poor, democrat or republican. I hope we can go to an economic system that is fair and honest like the gold standard. It made sense to save a dollar because it would still be worth a dollar in 10 years. Put a dollar under your bed today and see what it buys you in 10 years. I would say, get to know your neighbors and share resources when the time comes. If you try to hoard a ton of food, guns, and ammunition someone will probably shoot you and take it. I laugh at all of you fools that buy any of this crap! Social services? Please! Come to reality! How do you think this stuff gets paid for? Your tax dollars barely cover the cost of the interest on the debt. The rest is borrowed. This illusion is about to come to a crashing halt. The credit card is maxed out. There is no holy democrat or republican that is qualified to handle this. No magic savior is coming. Whoever is president is going to have one hell of a job. Also, study the constitution and the principles this country is founded on and you may not have to live your life in constant fear and ignorance. You might actually know when you've been duped.

your private non union job will throw your **** to the curb once you get too expensive for them to pay, insure and when you get old.  Don't be so confident.  Good work means nothing to them.

Those who doubt global warming or climate change must not have much common sense at ALL! I understand how it works. Why can't you? Or do you just think it's a conspiracy? Glad our leaders have more common sense than you do anyways. If you were in charge, America probably wouldn't be here anymore. Please, DON'T BREED!! We need smart people on this planet. Not apes all over again.

I have a 2011 Hyundai Elantra, and the 40 mpg was one of the main reasons for buying it.  I have never gotten over 30 mpg on the highway, and I babied it for months trying to get better mileage.  I finally gave up.

Gentlemen, may I suggest an across-the-aisle compromise? \r\nWhen did "global warming" become "climate change?" When the temperatures stopped going up after 1998. Since the globe wasn't warming, the term "global warming" rightly came to be ridiculed. By calling it "climate change," everyone played it safe since the climate is always changing, that being the very nature of climate. Maybe it's time to switch "climate change" to something new. Something we can all agree upon. And I think I have it: "Climate Wassup!"

I didn't know about the closing of the plant in 1996 southpark89. However, it was my understanding that Pabst was still owned by Pabst Brewing (in Los Angeles) -- but they did contract the use of six Miller breweries. But, it has been years since I went back to check and you could be right. I can respect the reason you no longer drink Pabst -- but, I still stand by my assessment that Pabst tastes better than today's Budweiser. If there is a chance they changed their flavor recipie and it's no longer truly Pabst -- that would be shame. I trust you are right on that account since you say you were a big Pabst drinker. I never understood why soda (Coke, for instance) & beer companies have to tweak their flavors when they started out with a winner to begin with. Thanks for the information in your reply southpark89.

didn't anyone read the report about the consumer confidence number -- they were going to modify it by taking out those surveys done with people without jobs and money. \r\n  \r\nThe reason being those people were bringing the numbers down at a time when the super rich were starting to party again with their money. So to keep the consumer confidence numbers being more realistic they now only apply to people with jobs and money to spend.

I found out first hand what an awful mess the American healthcare system is in when I suffered an industrial accident which landed me in a burn ward for three months, crippled my right foot and took me out of the work force. Healthcare is pretty nice when your company qualifies for group rates, handles all the paperwork, and sees that you cannot be excluded for pre-existing conditions; but it is a living nightmare out there should you ever lose your job through sickness, injury, or other reasons and must scrounge for coverage in the private market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my case, my injury (though covered by workers comp) disqualifies me from obtaining general coverage in the private market At ANY PRICE.  I am deemed too great an unknown liability and there is no place for a person like me on their for-profit spread-sheets.  Fortunately I had no family to support and I had my life's savings to fall back on. It was only by drawing deeply on these reserves that I was able to find and keep any sort of coverage at all, just not through the private market.\r\n\r\nThe only way I could get insured was through the State's (yes, there is that hated 'nanny-state' again! Meddling in business affairs and trying to look out for people), I say the only way I could get insured was through the state's HIPAA program of guaranteed coverage, but even that was a touch and go proposition. One mistake, one returned letter and I would have been SOL. To qualify, you MUST exhaust your COBRA coverage without a lapse, beat the narrow window of qualification (thanks Nixon.) and squirm through all the other pit-falls and hoops in the way of obtaining coverage.\r\n\r\nAnd even then, although the insurance company cannot refuse to cover you, they DO get to set the premiums; and in my case HumanOne jacked my rates up after the first year from $440 a month to $650 a month, an increase of 67% in a single year! In an effort, I suspect, to price undesirable clients out of the market before the first of the ObamaCare reforms hit. And indeed, after the mandate came on line that 80% of all premiums collected must be spent on actual health-care rather than profits, my health insurance rates fell back down to under $400 a month and I received a nice letter informing me that I may have a refund on the way.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that good people through no fault of their own are being slaughtered financially by the healthcare system in America every day. Indeed, one of the greatest cause of bankruptcy in America is when a family is stricken by serious illness and exhausts or losses coverage. That is you and me, my friend. \r\n\r\nBut while the GOP sought to stone-wall, dig in their heals and do everything in their power to see that no reforms were made, only the Democrats under Obama had the grit to tackle the issue and forge ahead.\r\n\r\nAnd now that reform is a defacto reality, even the GOP (when not vowing to repeal ObamaCare), is actually talking about reform, about allowing the 25,000 dependents to stay on their parents plans, and not allowing the worst offenses of the Insurance Companies past such as revoking coverage on the feeblest of pretenses once someone gets seriously ill. This is progress friend. It is a place to start and a place from which we can proceed. No matter how the election turns out,this is a good thing and Obama deserves the credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-Science_1

If you provided an education to every human on earth to the Level of PhD., The Average I.Q. would increase by only 1 point.\r\n\r\nEducation & Intelligence are not inclusive. We only hope it makes them good at what they were Educated for. Evidence of which sadly  is not  Very Conclusive.

I live in Gilbert.Az and I looked at the vehicles in question and bought a Chevy Cruze. I bought the Cruze because of what I read and heard from owners of the Cruze. My current driving habits put 8 to 10 miles a day light to light, no highway driving . My current gas mileage  is 28.8.The sticker said 26 city.  I will be driving to Tuscon next week so I will see what my highway mileage will be. I shopped for a car based on mileage ,and with that said,I couldn't be happier , especially since I truly love everything else about the car.

I'm fine with people making a free choice to live where they want.  I just don't want to subsidize their choice.  If the costs of their choice are covered completely by them or insurance bought by them on the open market (not subsidized by the government) then more power to them.

He and his Pelosi democraps love union contributions. they would never bite the hand the literally feeds them. Yes unions were needed long ago, though you can thanks lawyers for looking out for them. From OSHA to BBB to ACLU, all workers enjoy safety, fair pay and the right to work. Unions are only in place to keep union bosses (the mafia) in place. Total shamm and unions are long over due to be dissolved.

Yes I have several pairs of Ugg, but they are very pricey for the average person.  They are comfortable and warm during the harsh winter months.  However, with this economy Uggs are the least on people's mind.  Reducing price will definitely entice customers but then again there is ebay for cheaper ones.

Okay Rhonda are you going to start wearing a Bhurka becuase another nation wants you to? This people live in soveriegn nations. We cannot force them to do anything. We can try to convince them to pass labor laws, but you can't do it by being self righteous.\r\n \r\nCocoa only grows in certain areas of the world. Unfortunately the people who settled those parts of the world are not as "enlightened" as we are. They live hard lives. They have insititutions of slavery older than the Julian calendar. What is unfortunate is that many of theose slaves actually live better lives than the free children. You want to change their contry and mores go there, but don't bitch when people buy their legally (for there) produced products.

Uh, you don't understand COBRA.\r\n\r\nIt is simply the EXACT cost that the company has been paying for you, plus only an allowable extra 2% to cover the COBRA company Administrative costs.\r\n\r\nNOW you understand why employers are complaining about high health insurance costs.\r\n\r\nThus, the cost of COBRA is ONLY 2% by law higher than what your employer pays each month per employee.

The original Ugg boots are still great for their original use - keep your feet warm at the beach when the sun sets. Of course, that formula won't create wealthly stockholders, so instead of downsizing the product line back to logical levels, the Ugg company will probably die. Worse, it could be sold off to one of the many "global" vendors who have copied it for the past 15 years.

I like how this is the ONLY propaganda article MSN is allowing comment on. They have shut down comment on all their other articles promoting their candidate. pathetic and so telling of the chidlishness that is the hallmark of this media outlet and their candidate, Obama.

You do relaize that the child labor is nothing new. Milton himself would have had to buy cocoa from farms that used child labor becuase that is what those cultures do.\r\n \r\nHell in those countries farming, even cocoa farming is a family affair. Chidlren are taught their life skills by working along side the adults.

Jamey Johnston is great!!!  I also like Casey James, used to work with him and he is a true artist.  Neither of them get any play because they will not sell out and play anything pop'ish.  A lot of great artists get passed up, because they wont do crap like "shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees" - all sell outs. I keep my radio on 80's 90's country - it was still good then!!

Obama To Seize Control Of The Internet?\r\nA Commentary by J. D. Longstreet\r\n******************\r\nOur own domestic tin-pot dictator, Obama, is about to make a move on the Internet. \r\n\r\nThere have been consistent reports for months now that a Presidential Executive Order is being prepared for signing by the President -- after Obama is reelected -- that would grant the President and the government powers over the Internet. (Notice the deliberate distant I placed between "the President" and "the Government." Obama has clearly set himself apart and ABOVE the government of the United States.)\r\n\r\nOnce again, he will be going against the will of the people of the US. But what the hey, the man seems to think he has the divine right of kings granted by, well ... Allah, perhaps?\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that the Congress has been desperately trying to get a grasp on the Internet and each time they have made a move their constituents raise such hell that they have been forced to back off. \r\n\r\nConsider this: "When Congress attempted to pass laws earlier in the year — the Stop Online Privacy Act (SOPA), the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), and Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP) — to gain more government control over the Internet, public outcry quashed the initiatives. More talk from the Department of Defense about Internet security means that the President may soon pass a similar measure with no way for the public to stop it." SOURCE: \r\n\r\nPlease pay particular attention to the last phrase of the last sentence in the insert above: " ... with no way for the public to stop it." I submit -- there IS a way to stop it. That is to vote Obama out of office on November 6th! \r\n\r\nIt is very clear that after the huge role the conservative side of the Internet, the conservative blogosphere especially, has played in this presidential campaign, punitive action is planned and will be enforced by Obama and his Praetorian Guard. Do not for one moment think those of us who raised so much Cain and revealed so much truth about the lies and distortions of the Obama campaign will escape Scot free. \r\n\r\nAin't gonna happen.

So, Not Boring, how is one to be compensated for the loss of a dear family member, if not for being allow to sue the pants off someone?  I don't like frivolous law suits anymore than the next guy but this is happening with more and more frequency (or at least it's reported on more frequently) so how else are we to protect our pets that may end up in a shelter?  My pooch is in a fenced in yard, but my HVAC guy left the gate open, now if she wasn't so lazy and she had decided to go outside, she may have wondered outside the fence.  It wouldn't have been my fault if she had wondered out and been nabbed by animal control, but by golly if they euthanized her before I had a chance to spring her, you're saying that a free cremation of my dearly beloved and a free dog are sufficient?  (and by-the-by; vets prices are already becoming more and more outrageous.  When I worked as a vet tech, the only service we charged an office visit for was for the yearly exam/vaccines.  Now if I want to take my dog in for a nail trim I gotta pay the $10 bucks plus $38 for an office visit when a tech can just wisk her back and trim her nails in under 2 min.  So I say sue'em if they make egregiousness mistakes such as euthanizing pets "accidentally".)

Neither dogs nor cats belong in cages in stores waiting to be sold. \r\nI think it's a GOOD thing that the animals will have to come from shelters or \r\nrescue groups instead of "puppy mills."  I'm sick of people who are uncaring \r\nabout the way ALL animals are treated, and only out for their own selfish \r\ngreed!!  I guess this topic is for those who do NOT want puppy mills banned, but \r\nI had to say my piece!  Some of the BEST PETS come from shelters and \r\nrescues!!  How about we wait until there is NO NEED or at least very little \r\nneed, for shelters and rescue groups before we start BUYING cats and dogs \r\nin stores for hundreds of dollars!!  Makes sense to me!

I, too was an honor student who found myself pregnant. My parents, who are well to do financially, were not supportive and I found myself on my own at 16, raising a child by myself with no family support what so ever. I raised the child by myself in the ghetto,360 miles away from where I was born and raised and totally alone and still managed to get my G.E.D., enroll in college, maintain a full time job and be a good mom, because I was mature enough and smart enough to know there was no other choice but to succeed. I purchased my first home at 22..and never had a dime given ton me from my parents at all. Maybe because I had to do it in the real world with no help at all, I am aware that I, and you, are NOT the norm. I did not come from a poor, undereducated, alcoholic/drug addicted or abusive home, I did not come from harsh conditions with no resources and no options, so when I ended up in a harsh circumstance with no resources, no options and no help from anyone, I was able to pull it together enough to get through. My background is also not the norm. To compare yourself to anyone else is irresponsible, and it all comes back to the basic understanding that I am me, you are you, and therefore how you handled a situation or your expierience really is only relevant to and applies to you, period. I do not judge any other mother at all, regardless of thier circumstance, because thier thoughts , feelings and history are not mine to relate to. You are not an example of the rule, or you are the exception, Every teen age mom should go to counseling, being a parent is so incredibly pschologically and emotionally taxing it isn't even funny. The show was meant to show the REAL side of teen parenting..that it isn't glamourous and fun and easy and babies aren't just cute, cuddly little dolls. Not sure how that is lost on people??

The republicans new line of thinking, if it doesn't fit your agenda then it is liberal bias.  Polls don't favor Mitt, just say they are skewed.  Unemployment numbers too positive this close to the election, it is just the government fudging numbers.  95% of the scientific community in agreement that man is creating/speeding along climate change, nah they are bought and paid for by libs.  Akin spewing noise about legitimate rape that you don't like, nope it is just that devil lefty news slant making much ado about nothing.  It is really comical.

When are Republicans and Democrats going to realize neither party is always right or always wrong? This type of thinking is allowing this country to continue it's decline. I have a question for both sides. How do we change 75% of the items in America to say made in the USA instead of made in (Insert Foreign Country Here)? If we are not able to find the solution to this problem soon, we will continue to see the decline regardless of who we elect.

I think this is the media making a bigger deal of what she said.   I struggled with a couple of miscarriages around the same time and I can totally empathize with what she was saying.   At the time I hated all pregnant women, regardless of age, their struggles, etc.  Now I have a healthy 4 month old.   It is human nature to have envy and jealousy.   I know most women in her situation would have had similar feelings.   Just like most teenage mothers grow up and are fabulous mothers.   It is easy for any of us to judge when we haven't walked in the others shoes.

Well we all know what they say....  If you lay down with dogs eventually you will end up with fleas.  Maybe this is what almost happened to Cee Lo.  He most likely didn't lay down with her but the fleas are sure attempting to bite.  I don't believe he did it and she is after money.  Cee Lo let this be a lesson and consider it educational, and please stay away from those that think they can use you.  For the gentleman that mentioned that Cee Lo is ugly, please know that there is someone for everyone so be careful calling others ugly.  Cee Lo, Lot's of blessings in  your adventure and be very careful speaking to others about this.  The walls also have ears.  There may be others attempting and waiting to get on board.  They didn't bother you until you got kinda big did they?   Lot's of music to write about with this one.  Isn't it just CRAZY!!!!!!!!

Absolutely true. But I think it's fair to say the market is extremely volatile at times, and stock prices don't exactly match what the price should be.  \r\n For example, when the market tanked in 2008-2009, it certainly dropped below where it should have. And at the end of Clinton's two terms, it was riding irrationally high. \r\n Also, presidents have little control over the stock market, or the economy. But they like to tell us they do, because it makes us think they are more important than they really are.

Only in this country could the lyin Mexican Mormon Moron have such high poll numbers, although still losing. Only the braindead repuke dopes here can't see the light. \r\nHONG KONG — If the rest of the world got to vote, President Obama apparently would be re-elected in a landslide. \r\nA new survey of global opinions for the BBC World Service shows 20 of 21 countries favoring Mr. Obama. France, Australia, Canada, Nigeria and Britain went most heavily for Obama. \r\nThe only country surveyed with a Mitt Romney yard sign on its lawn was Pakistan, which favored the Republican challenger by 14 percent to 11 percent. (Three-fourths of Pakistani respondents had no preference.) \r\nElsewhere in Asia, Chinese respondents preferred Mr. Obama, 28 percent to 9 percent, as did South Koreans (58 to 9); Japanese (33 to 9); Indians (36 to 12); and Malaysians (28 to 13).

So they think a beloved pet can be replaced as easily as changing your socks???   How in the world could they make such a mistake?   Very stupid and uncaring people working in that "shelter". A shelter is supposed to be a haven of safety; not a place to be murdered.   Free cremation and free adoption??? Ridiculous and heartless.

ok, 1st off, Unions are needed now more than ever. corporate greed and the fantasy world to many live in that they are going to be the rich CEO some day have destroyed the middle class which was predominatly UNION workers, yes some unions are over paid, look at pro atheletes. but the majority that actually need unions have been so brain washed that unions are bad they are in decline. should all the professions currently covered by Unions be so, even i dont argee with that. but unions force employers to pay fair labor costs, provide benifits and pensions. not stick ever penny they get from twisting politicians arms to give them more breaks, raid pensions and such forth. very good example, walmart employees are paid so little in this country they collect 1.56 BILLION  dollars in benifits from the goverment, but walmart made 200 Billion in profit. but if walmart even hears of unionization efforts here they wipe the crew out and start fresh with " pro- right to work" idiots

I agree.  After 20 years of marriage, continually employed for all of those years, raising a family without any government aid - my wife berates me for being "boring, tired all the time" and "bitter".  All the while she adores her friends' husbands who are unemployed, hooked on drugs and/or otherwise scamming the system.  These "men" , according to her, are "spontaneous, fun-loving, carefree" people...

No Rhonda, if you read my response, it doesn't say I agree with exploiting children in any way. It has to do with the manner in which this board went about suing an Iconic American publicly traded company. If that is the way they go about recieving money for their retirees, then we as a country are in trouble, in that these boards will go to any means, as to sue. I don't know if you eat chocolate, but if these countries produce 70% of the cocoa world wide, then if no companies buy from them, they would be no chocolate.

Just as always, MSN accentuates anything that remotely might help Obama. while ignoring any downside for Obama. Obama says he created five million jobs, and MSN leaves out the fact that 4.5 million jobs were lost in the same time frame. MSN can't seem to wait until Obama makes this country a communist country.

Look I'm no fan of todays banks or CC outfits but IMHO it's no reason to ban credit cards. I don't give a hoot if they charge 1000%. People need to step up, grow up and take charge of their own affairs. Not willing to play the credit card game then like you did is pay them off cut them up and toss them. Make the CC company's come begging to you to use their product at a decent rate or you won't carry one. I really believe 90% of this countrys problems today are Americans playing the poor victim role and wanting government to step in and save them from themselves. Drowning oneself in debt on most occasions is their own fault. \r\n  \r\nBTW one incentive to saving and savers would be for the FED to get out of our lives and let interest rates find their own level. Both on loans and interest paid to those of us who do save and pay cash for the things we purchase or pay cash to zero out our CC purchases each month. I'm an old fart, old fashon and truly believe Americans have turned into a group of cry babies. Like many I've been broke before but learned my lesson.

Well if she is going to slam 16 and pregnant (which by the way, I think does a great job of illustrating how the lives of these young girls changed instantly when that baby came into the world, and their childhood and teenage years were forever removed), then I'd like to slam her for her constant use of the "safe zone" phrase in her show, talking about being past 12-weeks and therefore the pregnancy is "safe." Given her own baby struggles, you think she of all people would know there is no "safe zone" in pregnancy, and many of us have lost a baby well beyond the "safe zone," if not right before or during delivery. Every time she said "safe zone," those of us who have been unlucky enough to experience a late-term "miscarriage," stillborn or worse, were kicked in the gut. I love Guliana, but she should know better given her experience in this arena. Guilana - now that you have a baby, you are not a pregnancy/parent expert...just like everyone other parent, you are learning every day, just like those young girls.

My husband got a 18 mph over the limit ticket and so we went to the court and asked the Judge for traffic school and the judge said yes even though he was not eligible. I think it helped also that we were not the first to see him and he had to listen to the ridiculous excuses the people were telling him it was comical what they were coming up with. All my husband said was "Guilty with a request" and the judge said "Ok you get 1 request" and my husband said "Traffic school" the judge thought that odd until he looked at how fast he was going.

If you name a beneficiary on your IRA then the money goes to them and does not go through probate (it trumps a will). So if you update the will and not your bene the will would have no effect on the IRA and vice versa. \r\nThe money inherited from an IRA is not taxed until it is withdrawn and then I believe it is just taxed as regular income. I inherited an IRA in 2010 from my Grandma. I did the stretch option so I annual payments from the account. If it went to her estate, then it is up to whatever the will says and for the courts to interpret it. I believe it gets taxed differently too (worse tax consequences to have it go through probate). Wills also get contested all the time and probate follows a heirarchy when something is left to question. Naming a beneficiary on the account takes care of all of those things.\r\n \r\nI work in the financial industry. I find it a best practice to name a beneficiary on all accounts that you can do so. All of my retirement accounts have a beneficiary named (IRA, 401k, etc) as does my regular brokerage account (TOD-Transfer on Death designation). No I am not rich and I am also young but as someone who lost their mom to cancer early (she was 36) I started my planning early. I just had a friend create a will and trust for me (trust needed since my son is only 12 and I'm a single mom). It doesn't matter how much or how little you have; planning is very important. If I didn't do anything it would still probably all go to my son but then his father would have custody and his father (who I do get along with) does not know how to manage his money (major issue for our divorce). It would all get spent and proably irresponsibly and not on what I want. So I am taking care to make sure that doesn't happen just in case.\r\nNaming a bene on an IRA also has the perk of not having to deal with the courts and the time it takes. All you do is send a deth certificate in and they will send the docs to move the account into your name. It really isn't as bad as this article makes it sound. A spouse bene has it made and the easiest options since they get the account as if it were their own. Non-spouse is a little trickier only because of the 5yr or the strethch option. I usually tell people to set up the stretch option and if you ever need more money you can take it but at the very least you are not being forced to take it all withing 5 years and being taxes on it all up front. If you spread it out you also spread out the taxes.

Isn't it just a big cycle. The fifties rock was a little country. Elvis Presley for one.  Then in the seventies pop moved closer to country .Elvis Presley, Glen Cambell, Conway Twitty, John Denver were all classified and pop, rock and country. The Stray Cats were Rockibilly, Then Hank Williams Jr. began to draw the pop crowd back to country. People got hooked and country became cool. Yes. I was country before it became cool. So don't git your panties in a bunch and watch it happen again.

we're going on 41 years married, together 43 years (we were high school sweethearts, started dating at 15; no one gave us 6 months).  Best way to stay happy together....laugh often, take time for each other, and have pillow fights;  also tell each other "I love you" at least once a day, more is better. (texting  it often is great too)

This is a purely musical question.  I was listening to country music on the radio today and a song with "Mary" used repeatedly in it was ASTONISHING.  Anyone know the tune and singer?  It was probably someone I like but I haven't listened to a great deal. \r\n Cyclops 703

If this was a story about how the machine kept changing the vote to, Romney it would be plastered on every major news station in america, instead of hidden on this back page. What gives, sounds pretty fishy to me, I guess Obama figures he can't win honestly. I see where both parties have already hired attorneys, just for such an event. Her we go again just like Bush and Gore. America is growing more and more corrupt each day, I bet our founding fathers are turning in their graves.

Mother Earth is an ever evolving entity.  Man tries very hard to place items on the Earth as “permanent items” and Mother Earth reminds man who is really in charge.  I mean really, who builds permanent housing and buildings at sea level or just above sea level and expects it to last???  Water will go anywhere it damn well please and we all know that.  There is no common since in that approach.  The other side of the coin is YES!!! Man has been exponential viscous with how we have treated Mother Earth and her wrath will prove to us, we have done her wrong!!!!!!

when it comes to men and education the trends over the last 20-25 years show a serious decline in the achievement of boys and young men.  it begins in elementary school and follows them throughout life.  the reason for this is many and varied.  but the truth is our culture in embracing girls (no problem with that, i have three daughters) has turned its back on the education as it relates to boys.  I have two boys also and am strongly involved in their education and life.  it is the only way i can battle a situation that their mother and i find troubling.

No.  There was  a net growth of jobs.  You don't understand how the numbers are calculated; however, the unemployment rate can go up if more people indicate that they are looking for jobs.  I do agree the numbers are anemic.

This happens way too often. Why do they not come up with an identification collar similar to the bracelets used in hospitals. Then the id and number have to be checked when a pet is taken out of the cage for any reason. Seems like a fairly lower cost simple way to prevent this kind of tragedy.

@timodo\r\nOh, a memory you brought back. As kids we lived on a street that went uphill, and at the top, we always rushed to get to this one lady's house. She dressed as a witch, and had a large kettle in the front yard with a fire under it, and she had a large ladel that she stirred this chocolate milk in. We couldn't wait to get a cup of that hot chocolate. She had all the bells and whistles. Dressed as a witch, with a wart on her nose, a broom against the house, gobblins all over. It was great. Thank you for banging an old memory out of my draining brain.

Yes.. it is too bad that the projects were neutered or the ball dropped by state legistlatures. \r\n  \r\nA lot of roads were repaired though, and a lot of work was done.  We're a lot further along in the recovery than countries that bought into austerity, and their debts didn't get better. \r\n  \r\nI wonder who could have predicted that.. OH YEAH!!  Traditional macro theory that's been in place since the 30s.

"For those that NEED a car that has personality (maybe because theirs is lacking??)"\r\n \r\nFrosty:   The irony in your statement is most people purchase vehicles the MIMIC their personality, not oppose it.  So what does that say about yours?\r\n \r\nMy personal experience is that (as a generalization) Toyota drivers are the worst, slowest drivers on the road with no concept of road manners or a "fast lane".  They go 5 miles under the speed limit (presumably for fuel economy?) in the left lane and then cant seem to figure out why you want around them?!  I loathe ending up behind a Toyota, especially on a road trip.   My wife and I actually make a game out of it on road trips counting the brands that drive us completely crazy, and I can tell you Toyota has NEVER lost that game!\r\n \r\nAnd Frosty, I too have "fun toys".  I have a Corvette, travel trailer, jet skiis and an ATV.  Bla bla bla.  So what.  And I would dispute your claim about Toyota having "class leading power".  Since when?!\r\n \r\nOK, rant over.

Still a lot better MPG than most American cars can get.  Congress should have stayed out of it when American car makers said they could not get the MPG that federal law mandated.  Instead the dumb As$es kept giving them extensions.  They could have gotten better mileage years ago but for the inteference of congress.  Another reason to dump all incumbents.

sorry....but to win Entertainer of the Year....you need to entertain!  And who has done that more this past year then Kenny Chesney (nope, not a big fan) and Jason Aldean (BIG fan).  It could have gone to either one of them..been to their concerts...it's the ultimate in entertainment. Saw Blake at Country Thunder in Wisconsin this summer...the crowd NEVER warmed up to him..he don't play guitar too well (and even admits it). Some might say that due to Aldean's "indiscretion" he lost the award! REALLY...nothing to do with his performances. Sorry, but these awards and others like it are not longer based on a performer's real performance in the world of entertainment.  I feel sorry for both Kenny and Jason who were so much more deserving then Blake.  Maybe they both need to get their own reality shows (by the way, those are "fixed" as well).

BS..  Level playing field, no favoritism.\r\nBeing non union means being a company suck-A**..period\r\nAlso, as far as being lazy goes, any "good supervisor" can find a way to fire the employee for not doing his/her job.\r\nIts the management that needs higher standards for hiring employees anyway. \r\nMost union haters are jealous because they have something in their past that prohibits getting hired by union companies.\r\nMy company can and will not hold 'anything' against me for refusing to do work that is unsafe, or unethical, etc.

Gun rights were expanded with the national parks mainly because it was an amendment to a bill Obama wanted.  He didn't seek out expanding gun rights...it was incidental to his actual goal.  He's stated a will to institute an assault weapons ban which, in real terms, means a ban on scary looking semi-autos.  Don't believe me, search what makes a weapon an assault weapon and machine gun isn't the answer.  He also said "cheap handguns" are part of the problem.  Once this man wouldn't face reelection, we'll see the real Barack Hussein Obama.  He took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution...that means the whole thing...now going after guns would violate his oath...he's an enemy of the state.

Climate-gate was a hoax - not by the scientists, but by denialist media-moguls to contrive a conspiracy where none existed.  Your cartoon "understanding" of science and science history does not refute the actual science of global warming.

Paying more for the product on the front end, you realize, will raise the price of candy on this side. Further, if we use this argument as a model, and call all food industries to the same standard, we may cause huge price increases in various foods here at home. I would tend to give Hershey the benefit of the doubt, after reading the post of AfricanGirly...

I am trying to figure out why you people are giving thumbs down when others have such cute comments to give. I love cats, birds, horses, mostly dolphins they all make good pets. Animals like lions, tigers, bears oh my they don't make good pets they want to be free so they can roar! I love cats all kinds even black onesi with the darkest green eyes that look at you for love and support. Anyone who abuses animals need jail time. I am a dream of owning my own horse ranch taking care of starving horses and other animals who are hurting are most welcome even a homeless bat can come inside. You guys might think I am a bit strange but animals they love people too just look at shows like "Lassie" "Flipper" iThere was a story about a cat who saved her kittens from a burning home. Would you keep going inside a burning home to savei people? the mother cat was burned herself but she got adopted by a loveing family and all her kittens too. I thought that is a sweet story to share. I like it when there is news about animals keep up the good work.

No- but I did buy a pair of good quality boots at Squaw Valley ski shop- mink suede on the outside and lambs wool on the inside. In 1968 they were $75.00 and that was an astronomical price then. They were extremely comfortable and had shape- not like the UGG boots. Wore like iron. Wish I knew who the manufacturers were- never seen them since.

I think it's this way everywhere.  Unfortunately the employees don't care about animals.  It's just a job.  Our Pound sucks too.  They want money-they don't care if an animal gets a good home.  The Pound employees should love animals.  I know it would be a heartbreaking job each and every day.  This just shows that Pounds don't care.  Sue!  This wouldn't be a frivolous lawsuit.  It might start a chain reaction for all the dishonorable things that happen to innocent animals all the time.  I would love to see a BIG change in the way all animals are treated.

Yes , kind of sounds like the old American Family Farms, where everyone has to carry their own weight for survival. Nothing criminal in asking a family child to help pitch in for the sake of the family ! In fact it can be a very rewarding experience for them. i grew up participating in our family business ( an independent grocery store) I worked 70-80 hours a week during the summer months - right along side my father, who did this year around. Yes, I would gladely do it again.

WOW, research-first definitely chose that name properly but his methods lack facts which suggest laziness on his part. I made it pretty clear that Sheryl Crow grew up in a trailer park south of St. Louis, Missouri on the way to Memphis because I heard her on the radio talking about it as I was driving by it. I pulled in and it was a HELL HOLE. Burned out, rusted out trailers with pot-holed streets and most street lights barely working. I got detoured there due to road work and was scared i wouldn't make it out alive just like Sheryl was. Everything else is factual. If I offended research-first enough to make him move then my work is done. There are many Jewish doctors working in Barnes-Jewish. \r\nI couldn't care less about the zoo. The town is a lost cause and full of zombies. That's where the Congressman who believes in legitimate rape comes from so believe me I have seen my share of religious fanatics up there. Scary.

well, just to present an alternate POV, there have been studies done that have indicated that consumption of small amounts of alcohol, as in 1 single beer or glass of wine, did not present any danger at all to the unborn child.  that aside however, if she had enough to drink that made her pass out behind the wheel while driving, i'm pretty sure that kid is going to have some issues in life, that is, if it ever manages to be born with a heartbeat.

Hunter Hayes.  Awesome musician, so-so vocalist.  It's quite obvious he, Taylor Swift and Gary LaVox, lead singer of Rascal Flatts, all have the same vocal coach in Brett Manning.  They have no bottom to their voice and sing with a very nasally tone, with the same phrasing.  They sing in a style taught by Manning and one I hate. LaVox may be the worst live performer I've ever heard.  Unfortunately, if you closed your eyes you couldn't tell if it is Hunter or LaVox singing.  Hunter, I'm from Lafayette, know your parents and remember you as a five year old playing accordion and singing at Mulate's.  Get a different coach!  I know you can sound better.  Don't settle for mediocre.

When Ugg boots first came out, my wife wanted a pair for Christmas.   Naturally, all of the stores were sold out.  So I turned to  Ebay.  At the time, my wife thought that Ebay only sold used merchandise, and she made it clear that she didn't want any "used" boots.\r\n \r\nBut, I couldn't help teasing her a bit and saying stuff like...."but hey, this pair here says three fourths of the tread is left and the only thing wrong with them is a little grease spot on the left toe."\r\n \r\nShe wasn't amused.  \r\n \r\nAnd since I didn't want to sleep in the garage for the rest of the winter, I made sure she got her boots.  Brand new from an authorized merchant, mind you, and they arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.  My wife was happy, and that means I was happy ;-)

Hi there! We're doing well. Nothing too exciting. Winter/fall has definitely hit! Some areas pretty close by are getting snow already. \r\nHow have you been? Did you have a good weekend?

I have bought 5 pairs, one pair a year for my daughter.  I wear one hers every year at our state championship football game since t is very cold at that time of the year.  It is the warmest pair of boots I have ever worn, and they last forever. Her first pair I bought six years ago and still she have it and looks new.  It worth for the price you pay. I won't wear it at any other time but once a year but for the younger kids it is a blessing in winter.

Brad was one of the last "newcomers" that I was able to have a stomach for and he is even beginning to slide back down the slippery slope. Country has been country for several years now and I'm glad that I have a sizeable collection to listen to. Yeah, it's safe to assume there has been a changing of the guard!

@hahdaysboy  The point of the matter is about warning others to ditch credit cards.  Hasn't anyone made a suggestion of banning or outlawing credit cards in this country?.  If that were to happen, the practice of debt collection companies and the credit score will be illegal and extinct.  There is no better incentive than saving money up, even if federal taxes, property taxes or utility bills do take a chunk out of one's income.  Just one cent in the piggy bank from time to time can mean the difference between having a new sparkly car to being stuck with nothing new to have.

What I would like to know is why you can comment on mindless trivial crap like this and can't comment on the Ben'Ghazi cover up. I noticed that in your obama loving you have let some agency rationlize the murder of our people in Libya. Why no article on the USN SEALS comments on this cover up?

So people with Obama/Biden bumper stickers should have to park two lots over right? How eager these people are to say the rules are universally applied, but when put in to practice, they are not. I think this was an innocent mistake, not an attempt to influence others at the polling place.  \r\n  \r\nDo I think she deserves an apology though? No, the rules are the rules are the rules. Had they not offered her a jacket or sweater to cover up and just gave her the boot, maybe then, but it seemed like the election officials were trying to help her out.

Sales might be down but they will still be "popular" with the "image people." I have known some image people who wanted so bad to look 'rich" they drove new cars and lived in big homes with nothing in the refrigerator but the light.  Some would have you think their spouse is the top executive with a large corporation but when you finally find out the truth, they are little more than the bottom rung of the ladder.  Even in government, how many elected to Congress have financial woes even with their 174000 plus 82000 benefits? VOTE ALL INCUMBENTS OUT. put them in unemployement lines.

I really dont think I made a bad choice at all Logicalgirl.If I would have made a bad choice we would probably be divorced by now.Almost twenty years now and part of the love fades and some of the love gets stronger as well.Marriage is like everything else, it is not a sure thing.If you noticed in my original post I used the term"when my marriage ends" I say that to keep my self strong and positive to help realize how good I have it! I came from a divorced family and it was no fun and I will fight to keep my marriage intact. \r\nI hope the only thing that ends my marriage is the death of one of us in old age!! But like I said if and when it ends I will not do it again!

You're right major storms hit every century.  The thing is these storms are no longer hitting every century but every five years.  Please read the article since it explains how the conclusion was reached and, in this case, the climate pattern change that helped create this major storm.  Unfortunately the science for climate change is very strong and we as a society have been ignoring it.

The governor's ad is targeted to Bible believing and practicing Christians, who have every right to participate in politics - just as the agnostics and the atheists. It is mild compared to ads that are aimed at people who believe that abortion is a sacred right; or ads to make young people think of voting as having sex for the first time; or ads to seniors scaring them into thinking that a political candidate, if elected, will throw them off a cliff.

Take out the snark--I obviously like Emblem 3 much more than he does, but one can't disagree much with Barnes this time.  I confess though I am eternally embarrassed by some of the spoken words that come out of these youngsters' mouths.  Usually, something along the lines of 'how much it means to them' (and uh, not the others?), and 'this is all, I have no fall-back position, I have nothing else.'  Reminds of that climatic scene in 'The Jerk' doesn't it?  Po would be rich singer!  They have nothing!  Well, except grandma is okay.  Ok, music and grandma.  ...maybe, the cat.  ok, music, grandma, and their pet cat, but that's it.  oh, and mom and dad.  uh, Christmas around the tree--well, that's a little higher than unbearable.  so, music and grandma, the pet cat, mom and dad, and Christmas around the tree.   and the U.S.  it's uh, a little better place than growing up in Somalia or Libya, so if I am forced to admit it, I got lucky there.  So, music and grandma, my pet cat, mom and dad, Christmas, and the the U.S....

Lost in the 60's- Your name explains it all...No it's not the same country most of the time but it's also not the same music in pop or rock, I mean rock doesn't even exist at all really anymore not rock like the 70's. Times change, people change, music tastes change but there is still something for everyone in country today I think. Brad, Jason, Justin Moore, and a few others to me sing real country music. I think Rascal Flatts, Carrie, Taylor Swift, and some of those do not but they still sell records and have fans. One group I miss is Sawyer Brown, wonder what ever happened to them?

Strangest thing? We had a lady who would hand out miniature crosses she made her kids carve along with those tiny bibles. Her kids were not allowed to celebrate Halloween and the only reason she opened the door was to preach at the kids who came to the door. I read in a paper several years later she tried drowning her kids because she thought they were possessed by Satan. Thankfully her neighbor heard the screaming and called police.

There's nothing wrong with a **** from a willing participant. That's not sex or cheating. Cheated is what happened to us when George Bush, Jr. nearly collapsed the global economy and blew up the Middle East because he didn't believe in BIG Government oversight. Right now, Dubya is sitting in a hi-rise in the Highland Park section of Dallas looking out a big floor-to-ceiling window with bullet-proof glass wondering what in the hell went wrong. Dubya, it took 32 MIT-trained czars to fix what your 6 retarded country boys screwed up. Still think Republican is the way to go?

To bigpictureguy1 and others: \r\n  \r\nYou should check the widely accepted and acknowledged facts and records before expressing  \r\nyour very narrow views and opinions of what changes the planet is going through. \r\n  \r\nSome facts which are irrefutable are as follows: [Source information in parentheses] \r\nThere WERE over 20 named Atlantic tropical storms this 2012 season, one category 3  \r\nand several category 1 hurricanes [NHC]  \r\n  \r\nThe global rise in the sea level increases approximately 1.7mm/year, which factors to about  \r\n7" in 100 years. [NOAA]  \r\n  \r\nThe polar ice caps ARE melting, the north pole has had open water,  \r\nthe Northern Sea Route, otherwise called the Northeast Passage, which opened up to  \r\nshipping in 2005 for the first time. Ice cores establish this has not occurred since before  \r\nthe last ice age. [The National Snow and Ice Data Center]  \r\n  \r\nThe Greenland Ice Sheet has melted more in the past 35 years than in any 35 year period  \r\nin recorded history. [If the entire ice cap in Greenland melted, the sea level rise would be  \r\nin FEET not inches!] The Earth has major ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica.  \r\nThese ice sheets are currently losing ice volume by increased melting and calving of icebergs,  \r\ncontributing to sea-level rise. The Greenland Ice Sheet has also been experiencing record amounts  \r\nof surface melting, and a large increase in the rate of mass loss in the past decade. If the entire  \r\nGreenland Ice Sheet melted, it would raise sea level by about 20 feet.  \r\n[U.S. Global Change Research Program]  \r\n  \r\nObservations since 1961 show that the average temperature of the global ocean has increased  \r\nto depths of at least 3000 m and that the ocean has been absorbing more than 80% of the heat  \r\nadded to the climate system. Such warming causes seawater to expand, contributing to  \r\nsea level rise. [IPCC] \r\n  \r\nThe Atlantic Ocean temperature has risen 1.1 degrees in the past 135 years; North America has seen  \r\na 1.3 degree surface temperature increase in the past 100 years. Increases in CO2 levels increase the  \r\namount of heat contained by our atmosphere. Pre-industrial levels of carbon dioxide  \r\n(prior to the start of the Industrial Revolution) were about 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv),  \r\nand current levels are greater than 380 ppmv and increasing at a rate of 1.9 ppm yr-1 since 2000.  \r\nThe global concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere today far exceeds the natural range over the last  \r\n650,000 years of 180 to 300 ppmv. By the end of the 21stcentury, we could expect to see carbon dioxide concentrations of anywhere from 490 to 1260 ppm (75-350% above the pre-industrial concentration). \r\n [IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenario]

Willie Nelson didn't look or sound like himself. Nashville had nothing to do with him or Haggard as they were considered outlaws. Be that what it may, their music is/was country and what real country music fans loved and wanted. I first watched/listened to Willlie when he had a tv show in Wash, DC and wore a suit. I switched to Bluegrass music as it has never changed nor will it as today's country music is a complete turn-off with the exceptions of such artists as Alison Krauss, George Strait and Alan Jackson to name but a few. Would much better hear a good 5-string banjo being played than Tyler Swift.

This endorsement suites the candidate.  Mr. Burns has no heart, no compassion and he is a habitual liar just like ole boy Mitt.  It's a shame that nobody cares that Mitt says what he needs to say to the listeners just to get votes.  Unless you don't have a mother, sister, daughter, cousin, neice, grandmother, wife, girlfriend or a friend with benefits or just a woman that you care about, I agree maybe Mitt is the right choice.  Or if you are not part of the 47% that he really does not care about, then i suppose Mitt is right for you and if you like liars and manipulators to go to bat for you, then vote for Mitt.  I do not endorse this candidate at all.  I hope you have a great day!!!!

Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss.  If your non union then get set to see 19th century style formans and owners again. You , their slave, will do whatever they say at whatever wage they deem low enough that the "new" boss can afford his mercedes while you can't afford to buy your child food, clothing, or shoes.  Think it's funny? Look to china you idiot. It is already a reality and it's coming here. Austerity ala Italy. You non-union nits must have never seen a history book.

So let me get this right because the current country music doesn't have twang, or banjos, fiddles, steel guitars and the likes... it's not country. I guess I just don't get why people don't understand that music changes with the times but the genre is still the same. They are still singing about country living, growing up, reflecting on the difference in country living and city living etc. Just as Johnny Cash rocked the country world as well as Willie, Merle, and Hank.... so does todays version of country music. If you want "old school country" then listen to it, but don't expect to tune in todays country music awards and hear it because it has evolved and changed with todays times. It's a simple principle, if you don't like it don't watch it or listen to it. I'm a lover of all music - I grew up on Willie, Merle and Johnny with my dad. We danced to Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain as a little girl.I'm continuing that pattern with my little boys as we dance around to the likes of Jason Aldean, Little Big Town and Eric Church in our family room. And my guess is in 30 years they will do the same and the music will continue to grow and evolve and sound different then it does today.

How many more good shows that need time to develop are the networks going to cancel? Think Big Bang and other huge shows that were slow to start. Animal Practice was almost Northern Exposure (another slow starter) in it's originality and quirkiness. Why are the shows that aren't dumb right out of the gate cut and the total garbage shows still on the air? My husband and I were so glad finally to have a show we could look forward to mid-week- it was the only show we watched on Wednesdays. And to cut off the last episode to air (in our area) a rerun of 30 Rock? REALLY? I tried to watch the rerun. Turned it off after 5 minutes. Not nearly as funny as Animal Practice. Could have been a big show if they'd just given it some room. Too bad.

Hey Croc:  It is a bunch of croc!  They thought like so many other Americans have duped themselves into thinking that the Big O would not let anything bad like that happen to them!  However, when their Savior showed up, he kissed them, hugged them, and said:  "Don't worry. We're behind you!"   Then, he got his big limo and rode back to the Helicopter, which fly him back to that very big Air Force One, which dumped him out at the Big White House!  They are still looking forward to the change he promised them.

I never understand why servers think it is the customers duty to pay them for doing their job. They applied to work as a server so the business should pay them to serve the public. I do not like it that I as a customer have to pay a certain percentage to get food that I am also paying for. Next thing the customer will have to also pay the chef! \r\nI understand its a job but I did not hire them and should not be expected to pay a certain percent. I pay what I want to pay depending on how much money I have to "give".

No offense, Kim, but I think the best you can do if you've never been in that environment is to be sympathetic and compassionate. When something is so far out of your scope of reality, you simply cannot walk in their shoes because you have no idea what it's like. It's also dependent on the personality of the victim. Some people can rise above it and never look back, others need help. After a particularly difficult time in my life, I remember someone suggesting counseling and my grandmother scoffed, telling me it was an event, deal with it and get over it. I was able to do that. Yet friends with similar experiences needed the extra help of therapy to straighten things out. There's nothing wrong with that and no shame in it, and in cases of domestic violence it should always be available - even if people don't go to a shelter.

My wife and I grew even closer when we had our kids, I think it's a miracle, and a gift. It was hard to see my wife go through the pain of childbirth, that part was difficult for me emotionally, but the birthing part was a natural thing. I was so excited, and humbled, to see my children meet the world. I'll always think my children are absolutely amazing.

Exactly.. because again, if we look at traditional macro, austerity is self-defeating outside of expansion.  Attempt to cut spending and automatic stabilizers and tax revenue cuts make the deficits worse. \r\n  \r\n"NIESR said with the exception of Ireland, debt ratios will be higher in 2013 rather than lower in every EU country due to austerity measures. " \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAgain, traditional macro.  There's a lot of data supporting it, and what we're facing now is nothing that doesn't fit in the same models.  We like to think it's different, but it's really not.  So, as a result we're having the same arguements that we've had in the past.  Fortunately, the CBO has learned from them and labelled it as a fiscal cliff.

The way we calculate pollution is incorrect as well, In the United States pollution is calculated by particle weight per gallon instead of per mile. \r\nSo if I have a car that produces 9kg of CO2 per gallon but only gets 40 miles per gallon per our EPA rules that car is acceptable where a car that produces 10kg of CO2 but gets 80 miles per gallon is not acceptable. That is why you will never see cars like the VW Polo BlueMotion in the U.S.

That's really it LOM.  the fastest way to interest rates comig off dead 0 is expansion.  And the fastest way to expansion is fiscal policy.  Not necessary throw money at anything that moves, but hey.. how about rebuilding the infrastructure Sandy leveled? \r\n  \r\nI caught someone interviewed who was talking about how we hate to spend money on infrastructure outside of an emergency.  Meanwhile, with appropriate investment the emergency could be averted.  So let's make a dent in the dilapaded bridge list, or modernizing and expanding the power grid to support a nationwide energy effort.  This puts people to work, pushes private companies to invest in capital goods, all while solving real problems that we face now or will in the future.

Eventually the northern US will be subtropical like it has been several times in the past.. During this time massive plant growth will form coal and oil deposits.. Places like Texas will be once again under water.. But not in anyone alive now's lifetime.. \r\nYep, we are not good stewards of the planet and all the people making trillions off of energy today will kill anyone in their way to keep the money and power in hand.. Sure we have technology that would put them right out of business but it is locked away nice and tight by them.. You seriously have no clue that they control everything including those puppets in Washington.. They could crash the worlds economy and have us all starving and living a substance life in a month with a snap of their fingers..

When so many innocent people perished in this horrific storm, how can this tasteless stank is pose in the midst of other people's misery and loss? Why do good and decent people have to die in a storm like this and this $hitty cu&t gets to live?  I am not what you would call a violent person, and I am so glad I don't live up there because if I saw someone like her pull this in my neighborhood I can honestly say I would beat the living sh#t out of this POS.  When you act like a fool and are so thoughtless and inconsiderate to other people's suffering, you tend to reap what you sow.......ROT IN HELL YOU EVIL WITCH!

Angela, how is refusing to clean the officer's car disrespect?  Shouldn't maintaining his vehicle, just like his weapons, be a part of his job?  The article doesn't say the child was disrespectful about it.  Just because the man is a police officer, does not mean you have to listen to everything they say for you to do.  Police officers are actually public servants, and as public servants, they are there to protect and serve the public...not take advantage of child labor.  Yeah he'll think about it next time, but next time he'll look at police officers in fear, not respect.  Those things are not synonymous.

Thank God I live in a radio market large enough to have Classic Country stations.  That and Sirius/XM Radio are saving Country Music.  I tuned in last night only to have my worst fears confirmed.  Get this straight, record producers in Nashville -- I (and apparently many others) will not listen to Nashville Rock-Pop (crap).  We, quite fortunately, have 65 years, or so, of great Country Music available to us.  We will not be buying your trash.

Here is what I have done: \r\n1) pull over right away and if at all possible directly in front of an obstacle (tells the officer that you trying to escape would be difficult if not impossible). If you pull over on shoulder or the on the street turn your wheels all the way to the right towards the curb (same as above). 2) turn on all interior lights 3) take your keys out of the ignition and hold them out of the window for the officer to see them then place them on your side view mirror (tells the officer that for you to try and leave you have to start the car) 4) make sure EVERYONE'S hands in the car are visible 5) DO NOT make any movements without telling the officer first and make your movements in a calm manner.  \r\nTraffic stops can be very dangerous and these steps are to help put the officer at ease and hopefully in a better mood. This info was given to me by a Grand Rapids Officer.

Been married four times, the smartest of the bunch, #3 didn have a degree at all.  One did, and was an RN.  The other two were bright but I married them for their looks not their brains.\r\nI work with a smart young woman who will never find a man as she has an arrogance about her and likes to put men in their "place".  She is too stupid to realize that the joke is on her.  She will always be a trophy for the men she dates, being a tiny tiny asian, she is just another notch on the gun of the men she beds.  She has this attraction to big strapping Marines and other male caucasians.  She doesn't realize she is just their opportuntiy at fulfillment of stories they've heard from others about the LBFMs in Southeast Asia. So a degree does not equate to intelligence in love.

First, Hershey doesn't get it's cacao from "family farms."  They get it from very large plantations that are well organized and use slave labor of all kinds.  Second, it's not at all hard to find ethical cacao farms in Africa, or anywhere else.  There are groups that oversee fair trade practices that have lists of ethical farms.  Third, I don't want to hear anything about how prices will go up and we'll have to pay more for candy if Hershey is "forced" to not used cacao from farms where kids (and adults) are enslaved.  \r\n\r\nThe stockholders will lose a little profit and we'll pay a little more to feed our fat selves candy that at least we know didn't require enslaving children to produce.  Hershey already produces a line of candy that uses ethically sources cacao, so that means they have already found an ethical source.  It's not like they're stuck without one.  Every other American company that produces chocolate is already sourcing only from ethical sources.  Hershey's continued sourcing from slave plantations only encourages further slavery.  Screw all the good deeds they do elsewhere.  If you kill one child to amuse another, the good you do doesn't erase the original crime.

You never know.\r\n \r\n Her 4th marriage\r\n \r\n A woman who had been married three times walked into a bridal shop one\r\n day and told the sales clerk that she was looking for a wedding gown\r\n for her fourth wedding.\r\n \r\n "Of course, madam," replied the sales clerk, "exactly what type and\r\n color dress are you looking for?"\r\n \r\n The bride to be said, "A long frilly white dress with a veil."\r\n \r\n The sales clerk hesitated a bit, then said, "Please don't take this the\r\n wrong way, but gowns of that nature are considered more appropriate for\r\n brides who are being married the first time - for those who are a bit\r\n more innocent, if you know what I mean? Perhaps ivory or sky blue would\r\n be nice?"\r\n \r\n "Well," replied the customer, a little peeved at the clerk's\r\n directness, "I can assure you that a white gown would be quite\r\n appropriate. Believe it or not, despite all my marriages, I remain as\r\n innocent as a first-time bride. You see, my first husband was so\r\n excited about our wedding; he died as we were checking into our honey\r\n moon hotel. My second husband and I got into such a terrible fight in\r\n the limo on our way to our honeymoon hotel that we had that wedding\r\n annulled immediately and never spoke to each other again."\r\n "What about your third husband?" asked the sales clerk?\r\n \r\n "That one was a Democrat," said the woman, "and every night for four\r\n years, he just sat on the edge of the bed and told me how good it was\r\n going to be, but nothing ever happened."

I depends on the circumstances it doesn't say what all the tweets were.  But I would fire the person that reported this article.  Since when do professional reporters report to name calling in the headline calling this person a "jackass".  Headlines should state facts and draw the person to the article not state a reporter's personal opinion.  If he wants to draw his own conclusions that should be stated and mentioned in the body of the article.  But I still don't think in my opinion name calling is necessary or professional and is as bad as the false tweets.

You will care when they start it here and they already are.  You are the type of person that if it's not happening to you then **** it.  But what you don't realize is that this all AFFECTS us as it sets precedent.  They work and operate in these countries because there are NO labor laws, No minimum wage, No epa to stop their toxic waste dumping and here we are with little jobs remaining for us, so the next step will be them saying that if we get rid of minimum wage and we stop being harsh on them for dumping then maybe we'll have more jobs.

I stop at a stop sign one time and the police officer was setting a block away and a bush in front of his view and I saw him sitting there and I stopped.  He pulled out and followed me and said you know why I pulled you over? I said no,  He said you ran that stop sign .  I said no I didn't I stop.  I told him I saw him sitting there a block away and that I was stupid and would run a stop sign with you sitting there watching me,I told him he couldn't see my wheels if they stopped or not for there was a bush in the way.Well he argued and said I did and I said I didn't.He said well you can take it to court if you want.I said No it a money gimmit and greenfield is low on funds and I would lose and have to pay ticket plus court cost,so I told him WHATEVER,give me the ticket and be done with it.  He already had it made out or I wouldn't have gotten so mouthy,I knew he was going to give me a ticket so I argued with him. needless to say I lost,so I paid the fine $130.00 for a stupid stop sign  that I did not run.

I lived in a small mountain town that experienced several days of heavy rain followed by 5 straight days of heavy snow. (more than 10 ft) We had very limited power with many brown outs, no heat because the pipe had broken under a flooded river, two avalanches had taken out most of our water supply and no trucks could get in to resupply us with anything - food, water, gas, sleeping bags, etc. I had two little kids I was trying to keep safe when a knock on the door brought me a Presbyterian minister who knew I was alone (hubby out at sea) and invited me back to his church. They had a generator and hot water. That's what should be happening in New York. He didn't know me, I didn't go to his church, but he knew I was alone and had two small children. Neighbor taking care of neighbor. God Bless him.

I agree with you Lucy, those poor mother dogs have to live in the most deplorable conditions and are bred again as soon as they wean their puppies, they never get to rest and when they raid puppy mills, many times the mother dogs are to sick and weak to survive. Unfortunately people don't know this when they buy that cute puppy in the window. It is so very sad.

I don't snub nerds.  After much thinking about life, I simply decided I'm happier on my own.  I find that I'm just not into this "romance thing."  It just bores me, really.  But if I was so inclined, I'd marry a nerd.  There is nothing wrong with nerds and / or geeks.  I actually like them as friends.  They are lots of fun to listen to & hang out with. \r\n  \r\nGirls -- don't snub nerds.  They are fun and probably a lot less trouble than macho pains in the ****.

This is ridiculous. If you can afford to pig out on 140 bucks you can afford a damn tip. This is just a cheap ****. I always tip, and if it isn't a big bill I still leave 5 bucks. Wait staff can be treated pretty awful and they are just working like anyone else, they are not slaves. This does make single parents look bad. The only time I do not tip is if the person serving us is rude to us and has an attitude. I still tip when they make mistakes because people have off days and they don't mean to forget things. sometimes I tip more when I can see they are having a bad day. I also leave more when a certain relative is with us because she is always rude and demanding and treats staff awful. There is no excuse for this behavior esecially when the bill was fairly large.

If you can't afford to tip properly then you can't afford to eat out. The person who waited on you may be a single parent too and depends on tip money. There is no excuse for a $140 tab and no tip. Most of us single parents looked for deals, coupons or places where they have kids eat free specials.

The article says they took their pictures in THEIR neighborhood.  I could see the uproar if someone flew in from some other state just to take the pictures, but come on it's where they live. People need to get off their high horse and relax.  I find the comments people making on this thread a hundred times more offensive than these pictures.

How terrible. The owner is an older teen who adopted the dog as a puppy. In the source article he says the dog was his best friend and saw him through his parents divorce. FWIW Walsh does seem genuinely upset over the mistake, not that it brings the dog back or helps any. Maybe at some point when the pain recedes, Matthew can take them up on their offer and find a new best friend. Right now the kid just wants to make sure this doesn't ever happen again there, and I think that's a more than reasonable request.

This is what bothers me about tipping.  A great server in a Denny's gets, let say, 25% tip on $10 for a one person meal, $2.50.  Then you go to a 'fancy' restaurant where the meal is $100 and that server gets $25 when he/she does no more or less than the Denny's server.  Doesn't seem fair to me AND then someone has bad service at a fancy place and still tips them and they are getting 5 times the server at Denny's even when they are providing a poor service???

I have a mastercard,I also have a low credit score. My card cost me nothing,nada,no set up fees,no monthly fees. It is the best card i know of for rebuilding your credit and i have my grandaughter's picture on it. It's only $300.00 but if you pay it off every month for 6 month's it doubles! $300.00 isn't much but it can come in really handy for unexpected thing's! I also have a marathon gas card,and a walmart card. They are all the same as my mastercard,cost nothing to get or setup! Just a thought to those that have had a bad run of luck,but you have to pay them off every month! Look at it like this just follow the U.S. congress's role and kick the can on down the road untill thing's get better,or robme is elected. If that unforseen run of bad luck through some form of stealing the election happens charge you bankruptcry on your card and kiss your $ss good buy,we're screwed!

I personally dislike both of them for this reason: \r\n  \r\nObama wants to cut military funding (which I am a part of). \r\n  \r\nRomney was given a notice for the draft and fled to another country. \r\n  \r\nplease correct me if either of these statements are false. \r\n  \r\n(Also, has anyone noticed that on spell check the word "Obama" is listed as a mistake and the other options are "Osama" and "Bema"?)

You read one article that mentioned a sentence about the guy and suddenly know him personally. Nor has this single article proven where Hershey is getting their cocoa so to become this angry over such a thing would lead some to think you need psychiatric care, IF, like you, it only takes a few sentences to judge you.

Team Romney Admits “Relief” Event Was Staged for Political Reasons \r\nI also found this part of the story fascinating. The Romney campaign admits that the intent behind the rally was swing state election visibility, not hurricane relief: \r\nBut Boston wasn’t quite ready to lose a full day of swing state visibility with a week left in the race. So, after some deliberation, the campaign decided to use their existing venue in Ohio to stage a makeshift, and nonpartisan, humanitarian project. It would be a way for Romney to show leadership — and get on the local news — without looking craven or opportunistic. \r\nThey weren’t willing to lose a day’s visibility in a swing state, so they came up with the event and crafted it in a way that would still get them political benefit, but would camouflage the intent.  So, as I predicted, Team Romney saw Hurricane Sandy – saw the imminent peril of tens of millions of Americans – as a political "opportunity" to exploit.

Brosb - those places you are referring to are down near Denver.  Where I live, Denver is not considered the "high country".  I live in Breckenridge.  I don't know any "tight assed yuppies" here that I know of, and if there are - I'm sure we don't hang in the same places so I wouldn't ever meet them.  I'm not on my "high horse" - this is just my life.  And if you don't like it - sorry about that.  Jack - if you are 35 years old, you're too young for me. But hang in there and you'll find a girl that meets your expectations.  I didn't meet my husband until I was 40 years old.

And speaking of climate change, Donald Fagen's new album has a song called "Weather In My Head" which Jason accurately describes in his most recent Cerebral Decanting Listening Notes.\r\n\r\n \r\nAnd speaking of Donald Fagen, it currently occurs to me that Steely Dan was one of my earliest and firmest agreements with Bob Christgau’s writing and assessments back in the day. After being a huge fan of the first four and then less so of The Royal Scam, I was taken quite aback when all my friends did handsprings over Aja, which I thought merely indicated that they (my friends) were weak minded and fools for easy shows of sophistication. And then in some now forgotten chronological unfolding, I found this --\r\n\r\n \r\nAja [ABC, 1977] \r\nCarola suggests that by now they realize they'll never get out of El Lay, so they've elected to sing in their chains like the sea. After all, to a certain kind of reclusive aesthete, well-crafted West Coast studio jazz is as beautiful as anything else, right? Only I'm no recluse. I hated this record for quite a while before I realized that, unlike The Royal Scam, it was stretching me some; I still find the solo licks of Larry Carlton, Victor Feldman, et al. too ****ing tasty, but at least in this context they mean something. I'm also grateful to find Fagen and Becker's collegiate cynicism in decline; not only is "Deacon Blues" one of their strongest songs ever, it's also one of their warmest. Now if only they'd rhymed "I cried when I wrote this song" with "Sue me if I play it wrong," instead of "Sue me if I play too long." Preferring long to wrong could turn into their fatal flaw. B+\r\n\r\n \r\nThat people (not only my friends, but some guy who I just read today in fact) mooned over the title song but ignored the much superior “Deacon Blue” became a sort of litmus test of musical aptitude to me. So much so that by then as a died-in-the-wool Christgauvian, when Kamakiriad came around in 1993 and Bob didn’t A list it, I didn’t even bother with it. Nor did I with Morph the Cat. To find out later that they were the last two-thirds of a trilogy that began with the still excellent Nightfly was both a surprise and let down. Made me think that Fagen himself was weak minded and a fool for easy shows of sophistication.\r\n\r\n \r\nSo this week, after buying the new one, Sunken Condos, from Jason’s recommendation and then adding the five Fagen songs Bob did recommend from Kamakiriad and Morph the Cat, I can conclude that, if those were the five best songs from those two albums, this new one is much better.

Your article clearly represents a viewpoint from a liberal media source trying it's very best to sugar coat a very volatile issue.  Non-union workers are not welcome in union controlled areas.  If and when those non-union workers are hired in union controlled areas, a prevailing wage must be paid to those non-union workers forcing the cost of repairs in the area to skyrocket.  I worked for a major restoration company based out of New Jersey and Insurance Companies did pay for that adjusted wage increase but it was very common for the unions to harass non-union workers and try to use the traditional strong-arm mafia style tactics to try and force non-union worker to join or threaten access closures to the projects and cut off materials supplies to the jobs. \r\n Yes, this really still happens in the great USA.  Aren't unions a wonderful thing?  Your reporting on this issue needs to tell the whole truth and not just your one-sided view of what you think the truth should be.

Most of you people do not get it.  OBUMMER was put in to office to do just what he has been doing,  BANKRUPTING AMERICA.  If he can bankrupt America then it is ripe for the picking, the UN can come in and take over and we can really start to be ONE WORLD with the UN as our world government.  Why else would the UN be so interested in our elections and be monitoring them?  Answer, they want OBUMMER back in office to finish the job they, the Bilderberg Group, the Tri-Lateralist and other one world groups put him in office to do.  Their puppet Billy Boy Clinton could not get it done so they need this idiot to finish the job with his hope and change.  The only thing we can hope for is that we get a change in administration soon enough to get this country out of the grasp of the UN and others that would have us be one world.  Look it up Sheeple, the Wikipedia version is pretty well waterd down the real truth can be had by looking at the many other explanation of these one world groups.  If it does not scare the Hell out of you then you have no business voting for dog catcher much less POTUS.  Do Not trust ABC the ALL BARACK CHANNEL, CBS the CLEARLY BARACK SYSTEM or NBC the NOTABLY BARACK CHANNEL.  They are the biggest cover-up that has been seen in history for all things BARACK.  Think for yourselves please, VOTE BARRY OUT NOW.

I am a mixed woman (White and black) and my husband is white. I have to agree that white men in our society seem to have it harder than other races. However, each man stands alone and it is his responsibility to make sure he gets what he deserves out of life. Other races use the fact that they are not white as a tool to get over on others. What a shame that our society is not and never will be equal.

As you can see, Daytonian, there are forces (or in the case of ComNads...Farces) arrayed against our making any collective headway.  Maybe its subliminal racism or whatever, but these poor excuses for fellow citizens are hoping for a longer recession.  That is the difference.  If Romney were to 'win',  I think you would find Democrats coming together to support the new POTUS.  Republicans traditionally (at least since 1980) have Not!  Think about it.  Please....\r\n\r\nAgain, have a fine day.

Seeing the last trailer how the opposing teams are running towards one another, does bring in action. Assuming the adrenaline wouldn't be flowing watching the camera skip from character to character, taking in their facial expressions. And like you I've moved on to appropriate age books too. Though reading these books did bring me back to my youth when love was thought to last forever. Well for some on us.

Window sticker on my Prius says 46/51 mpg and I average about 51 during the warm months, but it falls to 43 from Dec thru Feb here in WI.  Not sure why it drops so much in the cold?  Maybe the batteries are less efficient and/or the gas engine needs more fuel to operate in colder weather.

Unions have made the democratic party it's tool only because the oil, realestate, utlity and financial industries have made the republican party their tool. I am unionized and do not agree 100% of the time with union tactics, but niether do I agree 100% of the time with those I help elect into office. You will never be able to please everyone all or most of the time. I am better off with a union than I ever would be without. Don't kid yourself, you have very little say in where your tax dollars go, just like we may have very little say in where our union dues go, but we do so in trusting those we elect to handle these types of things. Unions do need to adjust with the economic times and we do..it's makes no sense to make demands beyond our employers ability to pay and make a reasonable profit...being unionized with contract we can request financial statements from our employer, if they truly are in dire straights the union will adjust...we will take pay cuts, and we will take cuts in other areas. Unions are very intelligent in their ways, just like all those other NON UNION special interest out there. So go enjoy your freedom to make your purchase choice of a Porche knowing you paid some foreign company employees their union wages as well, you exercised your right, so let me excercise mine to make a decent wage with benefits and joining a union.

It is sad that a wr iter, in an attempt to paint everything a rosey shade of "nothing to see here, move along" doesn't EVEN GET THE STORY RIGHT!\r\n \r\nRead the story at the link provided here.\r\n"The general manager of Decatur Utilities, Ray Hardin, told Friday morning they were presented at a staging area in Virginia. The documents stated they had to affiliate with a union to work, which the crews would not agree to. Hardin said the crews were not turned away, but were made to believe that affiliating with the union was a requirement to work.  \r\n  \r\nHey, Jonathan  Berr, you should do some real research before you complain that the news is "blown up" to show "the arrogance of organized labor." \r\nI would say that if a crew comes to help a storm-stricken state and is MET AT THE STAGING AREA WITH DOCUMENTS THAT STATE THEY HAVE TO BE AFFILIATED WITH A UNION TO WORK THERE..... that says it all. \r\nArrogance of organized labor? How about GREED and malice?  The state of NJ is in a "state" of emergency and any help should be welcomed, no "conditions."  But not in NJ. \r\nJonathan Berr is a drone, LOST IN SPACE, and has not done his due-diligence.

When I was younger I thought nothing of going night swimming. Actually that was my favorite time to swim...the beaches were empty of people, the moon and stars were out, it was quiet and lovely.  Then along comes the movie "Jaws" and ruined the ocean for me. I went scuba diving in Hawaii and that's the last time I can say I have been swimming in the ocean.  I'll get to my knees in the water now and that's it. I asked my husband could I sue Peter Benchley for taking away my enjoyment of the water and he told me he didn't think so but with all the frivolous lawsuits going on now, I should have tried.  I'll just stick to my pool; the only thing I find in it is the occasional frog.

The White House increasing in real estate value only means it takes more money to buy and retain what one already owns. \r\n\r\nYour money is worth less and you just have to pay more for stuff and just be prepared to pay more in taxes.\r\n\r\nIn fact the real estate value of the White House should have decreased with the report of Pennsylvania Avenue making the most endangered landscapes list and a preservation group blames the problem on neglect and maintenance issues but to admit the truth about the neighborhood would not allow the steady and predictable increase in real estate taxes.

There are two accurate ways to figure out unemployment.   Total up all those collecting checks.  That is a pretty good indicator. \r\n As for inflation, M2 is a good indicator.   It is the amount of money in circulation.  It has increased 58% since Obama took office, therefore we have 58% inflation.   We have 58% more dollars out there.  Eventually they will be spent.   This is  why gold is up so much and the stock market.   The stock market will move higher the moment a new QE is announced.   We are currently printing 40 Billion under QE III a month.  That is about $500/family every month.   It will eventually show uip in the price of everything, but stocks, specie and commodities will lead the way.

Saph, I was going to suggest taking some business classes but I think you are just too dumb to understand. Bain bought weak companies and either strengthened them or sold the assests depending on what was more profitable. As for creating jobs, how many did Obummer create with his stimulus? We are $6 trillion deeper in dept . He spent about a million bucks for every 5 jobs created. 13 million more on food stamps and the UE rate is at "7.9%"). The only reason its below 10% is due to the vast numbers of unemployed that ran out of benefits and no longer sign up.

I fully expect a newly elected Obama to come after conservative commentators and bloggers -- with a vengeance -- soon after the election. Once elected -- whose to stop him?\r\n\r\nIt has become clear that they will declare a threat to the national security of the United States exists by way of the Internet -- and -- that in the name of national security, the Internet must be brought to heel under the auspices of the US government. A Presidential Executive Order will be signed, over and above the protests of the people of America, and THAT, dear reader, will be THAT! (Uncle Joe Stalin would be so very PROUD of Obama!) \r\n\r\nYou may have noticed the racheting-up recently of stories concerning all sorts of cyberattacks, including cyberspying, in the Mainstream Media. As the MsM has now proven itself an organ of the Democratic Party, one must view anything they report through the prism of leftist bias in favor of President Obama. \r\n\r\nWhat I am saying is simply -- we cannot know how much of what they are telling us about the silent cyberwar going on on the Internet is true -- or -- if they are simply following orders and laying the ground work for Obama's move to clamp down on the Internet and, ultimately, control it.\r\n\r\n Look. There was never any question about the government (or governments) coming after the Internet. As soon as they became aware of the latent power of the web and the immense power to influence others the Internet provided those not in the ranks of government, the unspeakable power the Internet placed in the hands of the great unwashed, the proletariat of the world, the dye was cast. \r\n\r\nThe Internet has become an adversary of government, and enemy to dictators, rogue governments, and over-reaching, power-hungry, democracies the world over.\r\nAfter the role the Internet played in the so-called "Arab Spring" uprisings, there was absolutely no doubt that the Internet would be muzzled by world governments including the government of the United States -- and the Rogue's Gallery at the United Nations. \r\n\r\nWe here in America can forestall it a while longer by insuring that Obama does not get a chance to sign that executive order after January 20th, 2013. We can vote him out of office November 6th. \r\n\r\nJ. D. Longstreet

My pastor stole all our collection money and went gambling....does that make me a bad person?\r\n \r\nObama wasn't the one that said it. Obama quit that church. What more do you want? Should Obama blow that pastors head off with a shotgun to make it right by you?\r\n \r\nWhat exactly do you want?

If you want to make more money then you should get an education and get a better job. The tipping system is messed up. How come you don't tip your gas station clerk? or tip your checker at the grocery store? I tip when i go out to eat and its usually around 15-20% depending on how great the service is but i don't want to. I do it just because its expected. Nobody tips me for my job. I don't feel sorry for you.

we always tip based on service.....if service is bad, then we leave just a tiny tip (they're used to being stiffed!) so they get the message (hopefully) that service was not good......i don't fault the waitstaff for food issues unless they didn't turn the order in right.....dh is prone to not leave a tip of any kind if service or food is bad

W#hatever happened to the real country music?  Couldn't even understand the words the singers sang, too much loud band music behind the singers, special effects, and I really miss Alan Jackson, Willie and George Strait.  The days of listening to a western song and crying in your beer are gone.  These singers should not be calling themselves western singers, they are pop singers.

Cute idea, but he's probably a secure and reasonably trusting kid.  His Dad, I hope, did a bit more in the way of testing than relying on self-reported reactions to pictures. Not everyone looks at eyes first.  Making eye contact can be a trigger for agression, so some of us avoid that with strangers and watch body language and listen for tone of voice and word choice that might give us a clue.  I know there's a combination of software and hardware that can be used to determine where someone actually looks, and you might get different results with live people looking at live people.  That would give him some better data.  The age and sex of both subject and target might be other differentials.   (Also, did he check those with Autism?  Or did he just want to know about average individuals?)  When looking at pictures, I gather people do look for eyes the way young babies do as soon as their eyes are capable of focusing, but maybe not quite for the same reason.  For adults, knowing where the head is on a potential predator is probably a survival instinct.  Punching a shark in the eye is supposed to help, for example.  On the other hand looking an agressive dog in the eyes may convey a challenge, and again, it's better to watch body language and listen. Some of us have learned that, too.

Don't use credit cards in the first place. Only bad things can happen from them. Debit cards ( where you actually HAVE the money ON HAND to pay for stuff) can be used everywhere a credit card can.... and no debt from it. People who use credit cards for a few extra bucks a year are assuming RISK. There is NO RISK with a debit card. What happens if you lose your job, or you get sick and can't pay it???? Oh, that's right, that'll NEVER happen in your case.... right ?? Not trying to start anything, I just have seen it WAY too many times.... Murphy's Law.

Sometimes cops are sitting in the area where they know people easlity misread. i EXISTED FREEWAY ONCE AT NIGHT using exit unfamiliar to me, cop imediatly stopped me telling me i missed a red light. I asked him for forgiveness not even knowing which light did i miss...i just turned right exisiting the freeway (still dont know what light he was talking about. Cop told me that he was sitting here for a while waiting for someone to give ticket to. He knew that someone new to this exit will not notice it because it is 'easy-yo-miss'. And he gave me a ticket. The same happened on a street i live in. Thye put new stop sign and right away started to ticket people because people were not acostom to this new sign...so they had a 'feast' charging tickets. Also, i work in a place that is remote. When i work late and get on a freeway at like 10 pm, it is empty and you dont realy feel your speed because there are no cars around, Withing a minute of getting on a freeway, the cop may stop you with a speeding. Thye know that we are and 'easy' target at late hour on an emtry freeway. When ressession was at it's worst here in calfornia, the tickets where given twise as often because they needed money. It was to the point of abusing the drivers. No forgivness. This articel does not tell you what to do. If you agree with the acusation, you will be ticketed.

I have found myself that this marrying up thing is ridiculous.  For years nice guys have been pushed to the side because we don't have a big enough bank account, or drive nice cars, or are able to take women to nice restaurants or for a good night on the town.  We are expected to pay for it all on a date, an outdated concept from the days when women did not work.  Most women, not all, are looking for a man with a good steady job but with the economy, all the layoffs and businesses going under how is this helping a guy?  In other words maybe if everyone went into marriage for the right reasons, love, instead of looking at bank accounts, or where they take each other for dates, basically ALL people need to quit looking at financial, economic, and MATERIAL things for marriage and start looking at the real reason for marriage, love, and marriage would be what it is supposed to be to begin with!!!

Obama adm.development of our US government into a vehicle for total submission of the people of America to a dictator;  \r\nObama, Pelosi and the jammed the most intrusive and un-Constitutional piece of legislation since the New Deal down the throats of the American taxpayer.\r\nThe climate bill's passage was facilitated by a wild orgy that some called "." \r\n300-page "Manager's Amendment to the 1,000-page Energy Tax bill" was at 3:00 in the morning. Not a single person had read when it was voted upon later that same evening.\r\n\r\nSo much for Obama's vaunted transparency and his promise of "five days" for Americans to review each bill \r\nThese tactics were necessary because if the American public had time to read and digest the bill, they would have marched on Washington with torches and pitchforks.

I worked in the shoe dept. at Galyans over 10 yrs ago... A store where we had to actually know about the shoes we sold. With that said, UGGS are NOT, I repeat NOT made for the winter. They do have winter UGGS, but the styles as you see pictured above are absolutely not!!! And your feet were never dry (Not with real snow)! All lies... Wet feet = cold feet. My friend ordered a leather pair and she walks in the snow (in Western NY) with bags around her feet. they were made for Australian weather. Sun, sand...they keep your feet cool in summer, warm in fall and meant to be worn w/o socks. I hate people that put stuff on just for fashion and have no idea what it is or what it does..., but you'll spend a fortune on cluelessness.

Sorry, this is pretty bogus. \r\nGo to an insurance company to get auto buying advice? That's how they make their money: from kickbacks from auto dealers and manufacturers who glom onto suckers steered to them from insurance companies and other vendors like MSN offering 'Freebies' - not so free when you're paying a premium price for the product. \r\nSame goes for any free addon offered as a collateral to your hotel, airline, or any other purchase. It's not free at all! You've already paid for it up front in the premium price you paid for the initial product or service.

LOL, Obama has done nothing for wages and benefits moron, his health bill states that you either have insurance or the IRS will fine you. How is that improving health care? And already many employers are stating that if Obamacare goes into effect, they will no longer offer insurance, the employees will be responsible for it on their owen. I know your obviously a liberal, but maybe read a little and think about what you say before name calling and saying idiotic things.

Tip well or don't go out and eat.  Unless, the service was terrible you should tip.  If the food is bad that is on the chef and owners.  They can comp you a meal but you should tip your waitstaff.  \r\n \r\nStay home if you are going to be cheap.

Aspartame has been a problem for every member of my family, triggering migraines in many of us even seizures in one. My Dad is diabetic and his doc said avoid it from the start. Your body is not fooled by these chemicals. Anyone out there old enough to remember the cyclamates(sp) of the 70's?  Tasted great-but the lab mice & people were dying of cancer at a sharp rate. Go back to pure cane sugar, in moderation!

In my opinion, the girls on 16 and pregnant are nothing but whores and skanks.  Have they never heard of birth control and condums?  And don't tell me that their 'religion' prevents them from using them.  All they want to do is have unprotected sex and then dump these kids into the foster care and welfare system to be taken care of by the tax paying public.  Tired of people like this.  World would be a better place if they were never born.  Too bad that THEIR parents never used birth control.  Stupid A$$ networks should not put these programs on TV and glorify these ignorant girls.

My wife and I bought a 2012 Hyundai Sonata in July this year. I am averaging 41 MPG at 55 mph, 36 MPG at 65 mph. 90-95% of my miles are highway. I am VERY satisfied with my Hyundai MPG. I think the sticker stated 35 mpg, so I am achieving way above that. Maybe I am the exception?? Either way, it's great.

As a married man of 15 years I would tell all men never to get married! Women live for the moment and the situation! As soon as they stop getting thier way(supported) they decide to move on. 95% of the time the man loses his **** and everything else in the divorce because the women wants to "stay home with the kids"and never becomes self supportive. Marriage is not for the males best interest in america.The divorce rate is over 50% for a reason right! When my marriage ends I will never get married again...  \r\nThe real reason women are starting to make more than men is because the job field for men is steadily deteriorating and the one income that used to support a family can no longer do that.And to all you women that say you dont need a man to survive,I say more power to you!! I cant wait to see all of you try and build something or repair your own cars one day!

I don't know how anyone could defend the waitress in this instance.  She could have easily fixed the order rather than just saying she didn't care if he was missing food forcing the diner to have to speak with the manager.  It might have very well been the kitchens fault but by her taking care of it the diner wouldn't have spoken with the manager so if the meal was taking out of her wages it was her own fault for not trying to fix the issue and rather just not caring.  And despite poor service and missing food the diners still tipped her and rather than be grateful for getting paid for a job she did not do very well she decided to steal from the customer instead.  She has no place in a service industry and neither do you it seems.  Honestly if a waiter/waitress at least makes an attempt at doing a good job or caring I tip well.  I understand it might be busy and its not always their fault as long as they care to make the effort or show concern a simple apology sorry it took so long goes a long way.

I got a ticket for 80 in a 60, I wasnt doing 80 more like 65,  I think because I was going around a curve in the hwy maybe it jacked with his radar gun. Or possibly the guy on the outside lane since he was passing me at the time. I had to show to court in OKC at 9 AM, then set there for over an hour till finally it was my time before the judge, He said enter a plea, I say not guilty. He said ok then bayliff set a court date. I asked if I have to come back , He says yes. I say I have allready lost allmost $100.00 in pay missing work, The ticket is $227.00 , By the time it is all said and done either way I`m screwed out of $200 bucks. So I pay the ticket once and done.You can not fight it unless you want to potentially loose twice the amount of the original ticket. It`s a legal scam and joe public has no choice but to pay the man. I just hope that cop get`s a big fat ticket someday, Or even better arrested for domestic violence against his spouse and has to jump leagal hurdles meant to do nothing but eat at his resources.

Domestic violence is a horrible thing, and as bad as I feel for the women who are victims of it ..... I have to admit I do not understand it.  I had a friend once, who called me after her husband/boyfriend beat her up.,  being a friend, I went there to help her in any way possible.... My first clue should have been that she did not want me to call the police.... but  I helped her any way  we got her things out of there,   I gave her somewhere to stay, and money to get her an apartment and  helped her find a Job.... well after a few  weeks, THIS DUMB A$$, HAD LET HIM MOVE IN TO THE APARTMENT I HELPED HER GET, and they were back in love again!!!! I was SOOOOOOOOOOO mad at her!!!!  Well needless to say he kicked her a$$ again less than a month after he moved in, and she called me again.... when she called me that time, I did not go .  I told her to call the cops and a cab ... I refused to waste my time again.   The point being , you can provide all the help and support you can, but a lot of these women will wind up going back to their abuser, wasting the precious time and money of those that are helping them .... FRUSTRATING TO SAY THE LEAST!!!!

Also depends on the state you are in.  PA is the worst.  Even if the officer makes a error, the **** judge favors the officer anyway.  PA PAYS their judges to favor the officer no matter what the charge is..  I was with someone who got a ticket for going 3 mph over the limit.  Obviously, he needed to make quota.  Some of these guys need to get a real job.

LOVED the show, although I only saw the first hour. Brad & Carrie are wonderful, at ease, and hilarious. I love Miranda but I don't think she did a great job with fastest girl in town last night. Eric Church was awesome and I am so happy to see Blake winning finally after all the years he's been around. Tim Mcgraw looked great, not crazy about the song...but I thought Faith sounded horrible on her solo song. Looks amazing but sounded off alot.   Little Big Town is really going to take over as most powerful group with hits like Pontoon and now Tornado. Jason is lucky his latest TMZ news hasn't seemed to hurt his career too much. I didn't notice if his wife with at the awards with him? Did anyone else notice?

I believe this is what the media calls, "deflecting".  If the masses are ticked about the jobless rate in America or the upcoming elections or the devastion caused by Sandy, give them somone else to be p1zzed off at.  Why not the Hershey company with their amassed billions of dollars for receiving their cocoa from a country that does not hold our morals and beliefs regarding child labor laws as the "be all and end all"?  Do I believe in their way of thinking?  HECK NO!  But the same people that say we shouldn't mess with another cultures beliefs and views on a certain issue, including using young family members to pick in the fields, shouldn't be suddenly turning their hate towards the middleman that buys goods from this very same culture.  That makes you a hypocrite.  Oh yeah, I'll still continue to buy Hersheys cocoa and chocolate products and if it ONLY takes 19 years to change Ghana's and the Ivory coast's ways of thinking about using child labor, I'd be totally surprised it happened so suddenly.  You can't force your views and opinions down the throats of another culture, or that same culture has every right to point out a few truths right back at you.  And believe me, western society has more than just a few faults when it comes to what is right and wrong for a child.

This article reminds me of my basic training days. I had the pleasure of being the first female to stand in line after the guys. The drill sergeant checked each of their chins asking "Did you shave private?" Then he got to me and did the same thing. I gave him this WTH smirk and ended up having to do 30 push ups. And my husband really doesn't care one way or the other but yes, shaving is ritual part of my hygiene. There is no way in hell that strangers are ripping hair off of me with hot wax!!!

It is sad to see all the Republican posters here trying to justify child labor, with comments such as "its their culture for kids to work alongside the adults" and "it would be hard to find products from countries that don't use child labor".    You greedy corporate pigs need to grow some morals - you are no better than other people who exploit children, like Sandusky, Savile, etc. You rank as low as pedophiles, you really do.

good grief!  Get a life people,  There are much bigger things than this to get worked over other than this.  How about a president who says in the aftermath of a storm "We take care of our own, we dont leave anyone behind".  But wait!! he watched while 4 Americans were murdered and did nothing.  They knew 30 minutes after the first gun fired.  There was drone footage.  Emails showing they knew.  The Bengazi scandal should be an impeacheale offense.  As a former Vet I can say this but active soldiers cant.  No Vet should ever vote for this president.  ThIS SCANDAL should draw our disdain not whether a model is posing in the aftermath of a storm.

The big question is why is Global Warming a political topic? It isn't political in any other country. Maybe it's because if the doubters admit it is a wise precaution to start cutting back on polution, then they would have to spend money on their factories to upgrade which just m,ight cut into their profits. So the rich, big companies lobby their political party of choice to fight the charge. After all, if they say it is a lie often enough, the party will believe it. I love how people that think they are smart like to argue that historically the weather has gone through hot and cold periods. True, but it has never changed this rapidly. We saw as much change in 100 years as previously happened in tens of thousands of years. I, for one, am not going to pretend I know more than the scientists! We need to eror on the side of caution.

For those of you who have no idea how union labor works.....The utlility job was probably already contracted by a contractor that was a union shop.  This would not be any different if union guys tried to go work on a non-union contracted job site.  If a non union laboror wants to work on a union contracted site, all they have to do is go to the hall and sign the appropriate book or sign in sheet to go to work.  There is no blocking of work or jobs.  When there is this much work that needs to be done all the guys and gals get put to work.  There is no "liberal conspiracy"!  I am sure you who comment in that way are sitting in a safe job atmosphere, working your 8 hour day, have had your lunch and break and maybe have some benefits and some vacation time.  Guess who fought for those things?  Read you history and quit sucumbing to propagandic ****.....

Cor Blimey! Was the sheila so strong she hurt the bloke? As long as it is not with an inappropiately older person, and was amenable to both parties, why shouldn't they be allowed a hug when they wabt or need one. Who knows; maybe a pet died, or something worse had occurred?  We all need comfort at times. Nothing I read said they were making out, so what is the problem? And why is everybody giving out the name of a 12 year old girl?

Billi934,\r\nDues are paid now and received in retirement like a savings account. If it weren't for unions saving the money for workers later in life no one would get a retirement. The non union workers that don't have a retirement will end up being taken care of by the Government.. (The tax payers). I don't want to pay for any more welfare recipients. So there are some good things that come out of PRIVATE unions. Now when it comes to public unions (The tax payers).. well they need to be broken up. All unions are not the same.

Duh, just don't be doing something that can get you a ticket to begin with. Otherwise commonsense would suggest just accept it when pulled over, don't be a dick, and be polite to the man. Yeah you might get one of those mighter than thou cops but good chances are if it wasn't to big of an infraction you can have a good chance of getting only a warning if your doing the things above and using common sense like I said. \r\nOne thing that bothers me though that was in the article, leave hands on steering wheel. I get it, I do, but sure does make it feel like you are being treated like a potential threat beyond the traffic violation, just something about reading and thinking about that, that doesn't completely sit well. Maybe more of that us and them feeling that we keep seeing or lose of rights like the BS we go thru at airports.\r\nI think its time

Kinda like congress allowing the fed to run our monetary system without ever having to open up their books to show the public what is really going on.  Romney wants us to let him run the country without allowing us to see his books.    He seems to think that just saying he knows how to run a business is enough.  If he is elected, I see more job outsourcing on the horizon.  It's hard to change old habits.

People certainly are adding to their savings.  There isn't a need for banks to offer a carrot for people to line up with cash. \r\n  \r\nThe only way savings can get interest, and we're talking illiquid savings, is if there are borrowers who want it.  Without them, no interest to be paid to savers.  Higher interest rates, no borrowers.

When my husband and I were dating, we went out to a restaurant in FL. The appetizers they brought him had been deep fried, and when he lifted on to take a bite, hot grease streamed down his hand. So they had him spend dinner with his hand in a bucket of ice water (thankfully he worked outside alot and his skin was pretty tough so no real injury). As the waitress came around the corner with our meals, she slipped and they had to be remade. As we got up to leave, the light fixture was somehow cockeyed and my husband whacked his head on it. The manager was beside himself horrified. We still gave the waitress a decent tip - probably the most we'd laughed in ages!

Bad service.  It only happens when I eat at restaurants with self-entitled, rude waitresses.  The Hispanic ones are the worst, and do not hesitate to treat people like tra**** a trait they've carried over from Mexico, where businesses routinely treat paying-customers like crap.  Don't expect a thank-you, please, you're welcome etc when dealing with one.  That is, unless you're white.\r\n\r\nI don't complain to management.  I simply withhold my generous tip and never return to that restaurant again.

Thanks for the review. Since the first time I flew to New York on business for DISH I have been watching documentaries about the Five Points area and Copper sounds like exactly what I would expect if we could see actual footage of what things were like back then. With Election Day just around the corner I think it will be fun watching a dramatized version of our past. I’ll probably watch it tonight!  I never have enough time to go pick out DVD’s in the store, but since I started renting from Blockbuster at Home through DISH the movies are already waiting in my mailbox when I get off work.

God saved his wife, but in return demanded his leg in payment for the "miracle".  On the other hand, do you think maybe his wife's cancer was cured by the expertise and medications administered by the cancer physicians and that this was just an unfortunate accident?  C'Mon people.  Get real here.  There is no God and nothing is contolling what happens to us except real world events and our own actions.

Iron Mike, fact is I still blame Obama because the post above explains why.  The last budget from the senate ended in 2007.  Obama and his cronies were all part of this slide so when you hear him blame Bu**** because he won't take the blame for his failings in the Senate or presidency.  Yes, he was part of the left takeover so the buck does stop with him.  He helped set the spending trend!

Married 2x living with a man now.  1st  (deceased) & 3rd man became disabled and  "house husbands". Let me tell, after 6 years as a house wife, then being steadily employed for 24 yrs  - I gladly work a 50 hr week rather then stay home. Housework is tough, thankless and never ending. The 2nd husband made 6 figure salary, blew it all and had women on the side. Has ruined my credit (6 foreclosures and 50K in cc debt - none of it mine) Sweet young things LOVE older wealthy men. Thankfully I kept my job when he wanted me to be a "housewife"   I'd take a guy that brings me coffee in bed over one that gives me diamonds ANY DAY.  (and I did!)  Oh and in each case, I had more education than any of them

The author of this article must be a coke head to think it would be normal for the parents to just want to keep the cocaine for themselves.  The use of dangerous illegal drugs should be in the minority of people, not the expectation.  Especially, when you become a parent your responsibility shifts from selfish self gratification to the care of your children.  I am appalled for the writer of this article to think the parents care more about getting a dangerous high than protecting their kids.  Shame on you.  Typical MSN attitude.

16-years is too little of life experience. That's what High School elections and Political Science classes are to teach. At least finish High School, at barest minimum.\r\n \r\nMy feeling is that 18-years is still too young. But then too, I do understand the idea that if one is old enough to join the Armed Services, then one should have voting rights in the general elections.

After Katrina, we had workers from all over the mid-west and the northeast helping us. And God bless them. Because we would have suffered a heck of a lot longer if it wasn't for those guys. I wouldn't have given a rats fat hind parts where they were from OR if they were in a union. Hell, we fed them lunches and THANKED them daily for their help. \r\n  \r\nNow these NUMBNUTS are turning away help because they are NON-UNION. God forbid a good man turns on someones power up there hasn't paid the precious UNION DUES!! Morons!

There is absolutely no proof of global warming. This is just a ploy to spend millions on research to line the pockets of these stupid tree hugging environmentalists. Wake up people. Things have been happening as long as the earth has existed. What are they going to do to stop a storm? We need to keep the air and water clean and stop all the pollution we can but when all is said and done with all the people we have there are very few things that can be done anyway. \r\n When the people of the world turn their back on God he will turn his back on them. Why should God do anything for people that do nothing but take his name and word off of every thing that they can. Prayer was taken out of our schools and look what has happened. Was there ever a shooting in a school before that? How can a teacher teach right from wrong when they cant teach the Bible. Thou sall not kill, steal and all the other things that are written help to build character in our kids. Most of the people in the United States are Christians regardless of what anyone says. Read the polls and you will see that this is true. Mother Earth is baloney Father God is in charge always has been and always will be.

It is possible that the climate is warming but very unlikely that people have anything to do with this.  It's a natural cycle of nature and we should be thankful that we live on a warming plant and not a cooling one!  The dinosaurs thrived when earth was much warmer, nearly everything died in the last ice-age.

I haven't seen the show and don't want to. But what I have read in the news and happened right here in my own city was that a group of girls get together and purposley get pregnant. To me that is awful to bring a baby into the world out of consipiracy and competiion and then we apprently have a show that make it look cool and get these young girls famous for their adult behavior. \r\nI always say if your going to act like an adult and have sex then act like an adult and wear protection or if you do then take care of your baby. I'm so sad to hear of all these babies and children getting murdered by their young parents because they don't have pacience. Trust me this is not for all young mothers but this seems to be the trend here lately. We've sucked the morals right out of society so how can we expect our young mothers to be responsible adults when they have no role models to show them how.

I would never rely on the old adage that going to court is almost a guarantee the officer won't show. A lot of officers hate going to court for piddly traffic tickets, but the fact they know people expect them not to show is one reason they do show. They also get paid to go, and if it's on their days off it could likely be overtime.

any of you republicans out there who is bragging about romney-ryan plan care to state exactly what their plan is. this is what i heard from them.1) I am going to get americans working. ok thats a good one now can you give me details how? are you going to do it by letting the auto manufactures go bankrupt and layoff all their workers? are you going to get them  back to work like you did with bain capatial closing down factories pocketing millions laying off workers and sending the factories to china? Are you going to do it by cutting taxes for the rich and try the trickel down economic's your republicans have tried for many many years and failed. please do tell us americans  Mr Romney how you will get us back to work. 2) repeal healthcare hmmm good one romney so you want to take away a law that forces insurance companies to insure everone not just those who they chose. and you want the tax payers to continue to pay for all of those who dont get insurance because they dont have to and  hospitals cant refuse them. yep good plan. 3) cut the deficit wow thats huge for a republican as in all their year they have never cut the deficit but I will give you credit you say you have a plan Mr Romney, cut healthcare, cut medicade, cut education, cut planned parenting, cut teachers, and cut taxes for all americans even though we know the rich will gain the most. so when you cut all those programs Mr Romney how many millions of jobs yo figure will go with those cuts? so again Mr Romney I will ask you how are you going to get americans working again

You must have missed this part of the article: \r\n "WAFF news director Adam Henning told me before the utility's statement was issued the station stands by its story. Ray Hardin, the general manager of Decatur, told  on Friday that officials from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers presented workers with documents that "required our folks to affiliate with the union," which the company wouldn't agree to. It's unclear exactly what that means."

What's hilarious to me is people put "science" as some sort of seperate entity. Science is the study of knowledge we get based on facts we learn from what is happening on, in and from this planet correct? Or is it something people think is going to rule the planet someday? I actually read one comment from someone calling out another person for their opinion and saying that "we are evolving just like the planet is and we are not going back to being apes"! The last time I checked apes are still here. Also the last time I checked the great thinkers, scientists, philosophers and astronomers of decades and centuries past have had most of their theories proven wrong! Granted we have come a long way but to think we have everything figured out and we can all call it a day is ridiculous!! All these people thinking there couldn't possibly be intelligent design and support science to explain everything miss the point of what science is all about. Science should always be unbias and thats not what happens at all. All it does is gives people a reason to be arrogant and rude. Everybody that points to one or two things as the reason this or that happened misses how complex the world actually is. Is there something happening? Yes! Could it be due to our presence and how we are treating this planet? sure. Could it be due to other things as well? sure! I think I have a little insight to this issue. Everybody has got everything figured out and everybody has got to be right and ready to point that "I told you so finger"! No one wants to remain teachable and think well there could be A LOT of things at play here and lets just keep on studying this planet and gather the data and keep learning. I could be right and then again maybe not is never thought of. Welcoming others ideas is not happening either. Everybodys calling everyone stupid and I am right and your wrong. This kind of reminds me of the debates. A bunch of 7 and 8 year olds talking over each other and pointing fingers. Truth is neither of these yahoos are fit to run this country as much as any of us are fit to say WE KNOW HOW THESE STORMS ARE HAPPENING 100%!

Someone; the stick models are on the magazine because some French and Italian half-wit that can't design a decent pair of gloves (let alone an outfit) wanted to save on fabric for their ego feeding shows.

I agree. Country music has become very poppy sounding. I don't mind a little pop but prefer more country side to the music. If you haven't before I suggest checking out Keith Urban's "The Ranch" cd. He is another artist who has become more pop than country. I wish he would get back to his more country side in his music.

As for Ashton some people are born with a silver spoon in their A$$ and even though talentless still make it.  Frankly, I don't think any entertainers should be pulling in the $$$ they do and that includes the ones that can act and entertain.  The $$$ should go to the milatary, firefighters, police and others that put their lifes on the line for you.  The politicians should not only be receiving the $$ they are they should be thoroughly investigated and qualified prior to being allowed to run for any position.  How some of these people ever got to run is beyond me.  I also feel that if your not doing your job properly you should be evicted.  I don't care who or what position you hold.

Now this is fact. The increase in woman looking to be overly educated and changing status is one of the big reasons why the country is in deficit and why choas looms. I'll explain. Because women are getting overly educated and earning more, they tend to see themselves as equal to men which leads to more break up marriages and fewer children. Now fewer children means the generational trend of the country would have a large Old people population which means an increase in healthcare paid for by a smaller Young people population, hence larger government spending on healthcare, hence a bigger deficit in the country's budget etc. You know the rest!

I was nice to the cop who stopped me back this Summer and the motherfather still wrote me a ticket saying I was speeding 50 on a 35 yeah whatever.  I told him I was not speeding my radar/cruise control  is on and it is always on that is what keeps me from ever speeding and I was tired (saying the truth got me nowhere w/ this cop).  I had been moving all day and I just wanted to get home w/ my son (my son w/ in the passengers seat by the way)  and have something to eat and rest after a long hot day of moving. I was tired is all.  Sad because my home had been foreclosed on. :(  \r\nLike I said the motherfather still gave me a ticket that is why I hate cops. I called my lawyer to handle this crap ticket in court.  I don't have time to be playing with these cops especially when I have to be at work to pay my bills. I did nothing wrong. He was in a undercover car plain white he was there to catch (drug dealings) not speeders.  I was in the wrong place at the wrong time is all.  \r\nThe other cop the following year was in an unmarked SUV he said I passed him in a high speed.  Again I said the same thing.  I was not speeding that is why my radar detector is on to keep me going in the right speed not to mention my cruise control is always set on the speed limit. My to forms of keeping me going in the correct speed all the time. So he went checked and came back to my car and said "I see you don't make speeding a habit so I'm not going to write you a ticket" just a warning to you "slow down". That was it we both went our merry way.

Climate change is another government department that helps the unemployment numbers. I can remember tornado's in michigan back in the 50's. They ran their course for a few years and now they are gone. Now they are in other parts of the mid-west. We use to have tons of snow in Detroit. Now, if any, a few inches. The weather is cyclical and if Global warming is such a factor, why isn't china being devastated ?  They are the biggest polluters in the world. All the green energy cars...have they made disposal of their batteries safe ?  All the mercury in the lame light bulbs that the government is pushing. Is their a disposal set-up for that? So you bury all this in the land fills and instead of saving the groundwater, we now have clean air to breath but no water to drink. Remember the story, " you can't put the buggy in front of the horse". Have they unionized the climate change puppets yet?

Hopefully the stupid people above won't be voting.  My dog would be a better choice than the moron taking up space in the white house.  The guy had about 5 minutes political experience.  It's like saying you just got your learner's permit and now you're going off to race in the Indy 500.  I bet you give him credit for "fixing" everything.  He hasn't fixed anything, things are worse.  He's stealing from taxpayers and retirees who have EARNED there Social Security, and all he did to "take bin Laden down" was get the hell out of the way of the military.  And let's try simple math.  If you have $20 and you spend $10 how much is left?  $10.  The idiot you people call your president would have you believe that if you spend $20 you'll have $30 left.  You don't spend your way to more money.  It's called simple math and logic.   \r\n  \r\nDear liberal, left-wing idiots, \r\nPlease stay in your trailer park/project and away from the polls.   \r\nSincerely, \r\nAn educated taxpayer with common sense

Son is a member of a non-union utility contractor that is in New Jersey. Said there were a lot of angry people, some appearing to be residents, that were throwing eggs, other stuff at utility workers. Seems the folk are either angry at the slow response of getting power up (evidently, the contractors have been waiting for orders to be dispatched to areas in need by the local utility company) or the possiblity of union/company hostility to non-union workers. Hmmm...sounds like a consideration for taking expertise elsewhere. It's a recipe for a no-win situation.

I agree with you, danielhm.  The two party system has been a failure, not giving Americans real choice.  The DNC and RNC put their candidates out there and tell us, this is it, like it or not; Bush vs. Gore?  Bush vs. Kerry?  Obama (with no resume to speak of) vs. McCain?  These are the best people the DNC and RNC can come up with?   These are the people that can "fix" our woes?   It hasn't been working very well as of late; $16 trillion in the red, real unemployment over 10% (not talking reported unemployment), a failing educational system, failing healthcare system, foreign policy is a joke, infrastructure problems......... Some can't understand that doing the same thing over and over will not get you different results.

This guy (Mitt)  is an idiot and I can't believe that anyone is considering voting for him much less endorsing him. How can he compare a tragedy where people have lost their lives in a hurricane to a high school football game! At least Obama is compassionate and genuinely cares for this country and everyone in it and is trying to make a valiant effort to make things better for all of us. Mitt has no compassion for this country or any of us...clearly said in this heartless football statement. Mitt for president? Seriously? I hope not!

Barry- Akitas are known to attack children- especially the very small children in their own family.  It's a tragedy people don't research breeds more thoroughly before allowing children to play with them.  I've met several children mauled by Akitas.  And I've euthanized a few of that breed for that very reason. People forget dogs are not humans and they need to be respected as the animals they are.  No dog is 100% safe in every situation, no matter what their owners want to believe.

You sound like a very angry person. I appreciate your opinion but, human touch is required for proper emotional development. You probably were raised by people who were convinced there is something wrong with physical contact. It is a shame \r\nyou are unable to appreciate affection. It is sad people are not "annoyed" by bullying or the endless parade of violent images we are subjected to constantly. Chances are you need some help with your immune system since it isn't normal to be sick all the time.

This article has some truth to it. I have been pulled over twice in the last six months for seatbelt violations AND speeding...both violations in both instances. I was calm and respectful, and I was completely honest with both officers. Both times I was let off the hook for the speeding and only issued a small ticket for the seatbelt violations.

Mr. Mittens is truly delusional.  Trying to make an analogy between trash on rich kids' football fields and the billions of $$$ of damage and countless lives lost is simply incredible.  The man is so far out of touch with life in the real world, he's lost when trying to relate to it.\r\n \r\nCan't wait for Nov. 7, when he and Queen Ann can move to their little $12 million cottage in La Jolla, and try to decide which of the fleet of Ann's Caddies will fit into the garage elevator.

I just remember being an overworked waitress   and something like this would happen ( the customer complaining not the stealing)  and  getting my wages  cut for it . That , however is  no reason to make assumptions and hateful statements. Again, I apologize .

His comparison is precisely why the moniker, "Mittwit" fits.  The scary thing is all the thumbs-down republican employees paid to log on this and other sites actually produce.  Like true virulent, invasive mutant scum, they won't stay quarantined over at Stormfront and redstate and other such bastions of ignorance, stupidity, pseudoscience, and myth.  They've gotta troll here and other places in their attempt to get the goat of humans.  But I digress.  Mittwit is equal parts sad and pathetic and the POTUS is right, whenever he's opened his mouth on anything, he's been wrong.

I'm very wary and suspicious of all of this. Surely,surely Hershey would not KNOWINGLY buy cocoa reaped in 'child labor' countries. But if they did, they must pay the price. There are other companies that use cocoa NOT tainted by child labor. We must watch this one closely...just another voice...

Nothing has improved.  Some individuals are so seriously out of touch with reality.\r\n\r\nSo there are a few (seasonal only) new jobs now.  Things are going to get much worse if Obama is permitted to stay in office.\r\n\r\n \r\nIf you have not voted yet, please do not vote for Obama.  I work for three universities and I have literally witnessed thousands upon thousands of lives completely destroyed over the past four years as a direct result of varying things that Obama has done or implemented.  He has no experience and he knows not what he is doing.   \r\n  \r\nI understand that many people do not seem to realize what has really been going on and for some strange reason they believe in this guy.  I guess many people believed in Hitler too, for some strange reason. \r\n  \r\nJust please do not vote for Obama. \r\n  \r\nThank you.

I never tip anymore get it out of your employer....Food is over priced by 400% so tips are a thing of the past. Governments are going after point of sale electonic transactions because taxes are not being paid on tips. So rather than give it to the government or pay servers cash and help them with their tax evasion I guess you are out of luck on getting any tips. Before you all start screaming I just don't bother going to restaurants anymore so dont get excited. If your employer doesn't pay you enough to live with out tips then It sounds to me like everyone is taking advantage of you.

This is a funny video featuring the Simpson's character Mr. BURNS, and it is almost as funny as two idiots standing at a podium bad mouthing each other while taking TURNS, and the more that they argue the more about them everybody LEARNS, and information about them is disclosed, everything from them having big feet to their house being decorated with FERNS, and the issue that always comes up is how much taxes will a person pay as compared to how much that he EARNS....In the end it all comes down to how we the people VOTE, and our choice will either help us all out or sink us deeper in the swampy MOTE, and the fact is that the chosen one will have the power to take the shirt off of your back, or send you out in frigid cold weather without a COAT, and they love this power because it gives them the chance to brag and GLOAT, and also gives them stories to tell friends and family such as how many checks last month that he WROTE, including one extra-large one to purchase his big awesome dream BOAT, and one for his wife to buy a golden bag known as a TOTE....Just remember that everyone has a chance to get on TOP, and enjoy a life filled with the Hibbity, Dibbity, BOP, and a Pee, Pie, Po, POP!!!!!!!!!

If Microsoft would be kind enough to remove Jeff-R... an obvious paid political poster with false information designed only to confuse...\r\n\r\nMaybe the rest of us adults can take a sober look at the growing discord in NYC. It isn't enough that they are still reeling from one disaster, but yet another is bearing down on them. In only DAYS, there is widespread gouging and hoarding, much like every 3rd World country worldwide. Not a comment of comparison, but a comment of SENSE, suggesting that more game-playing people like the Party of NO (who STILL haven't showed up for work yet!!!) in Congress are completely unwanted. That a Presidential candidate who whines about the unemployment rate when his OWN business just mass-terminated another business full of personnel-- is TRULY not wanted in America. Come on, America... an entire "party" went after one man for FOUR years. Free him with a re-election and flush the crap out of Congress in favor of cooperation. Its a complete shame and sham that Romney fully ignored the East Coast disaster because his vote was shrinking in Ohio. May we NEVER get strapped with a piece of crap like that!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nHey Microsoft... I keep writing you about the ILLEGAL default to BEST. You are treading on our 1st Amendment Rights. Change it back to NEWEST, today. Tell the Koches, Rove and the Bushes what they can do with their financial omnipotent manipulation. It's not a game, folks. it's genuine TERRORISM.

Hershey exploiting children? \r\nThe prime beneficary and stockholder of The Hershey Company is the Milton Hershey School.  Check it out.  It provides a fairytale dream to about 1,800 underprivelged kids.  I consume Hershey products without any guilt whatsoever because because I know it supports a good cause.  \r\n  \r\nThe people who are directly responsible for any West African child exploitation are the governments of West African countries and the coccoa growers there.  Not Hershey.

I know it is frustrating but hey it is too that she doesn't even have the baby on the show and she is already hiring nannies,baby nurses. The other one was it really  important to show on the show that your baby's first 2 months will be spent at four season hotel? Really? At that point I was so disgust and  stopped watching the show . It is all about showing off what she has. I've never seen she did anything about orphanage. All about how much clothes she has, how many designers she has to work on her house...\r\nSo if she cannot even take care of her own kid (by this I mean about nannies,nurses) she  shouldn't judge other people.

Every minor restriction the Chinese authorities impose is one more step toward a new revolution there: a double-edged sword for the US. If China ever becomes truly democratic, we wiill have a more daunting competitor than we now do. Makes it kinda hard to really root for human rights there and just might reveal why our government is hardly ever seriously dedicated to helping groups in other countries overthrow repressive regimes and frequently mollifies some regimes that are polar opposite of our own.

WHAT?  The Chosen Ones are the ones who have embraced Jesus as their Saviour, repented and been baptized!  If You've ever read the book of Paul, his epistles (letters) about the new, young Christian faith, he admonishes that the Jews of the OLD faith are no better than the new Christians, circumcized or not,  and are all your brothers IN Christ!\r\nGive me a break (amputation or not!) and read your bible before making statements of MONUMENTAL stupidity!  And yes, Jesus was a Jew, but he preached about love, sharing and forgiveness, and NOT just blindly following all of the old Abrahamic laws because of fear of retribution.  There is so much more to being a Chosen One than just following the OLD Hebraic laws, and Jesus himself preached such!  And no one of the followers of Abraham control me!  Yes, they may be bankers, lawyers and moguls, but so are Catholics, Mormons and Christians.  Oh yes.. And please do NOT forget atheists, such as Mark Zuckerberg (yes, BORN a Jew, but now an avowed atheist!).

The more you talk, the more you sound like you have a can of alpo in your mouth??? Are you spawned with waves of beef and chicken and Jelly? Can someone of your caliber smear such a thing on 2 slices of toast like Peanut Butter..... Maybe you're more into a 9 lives kind of thing..... Wait!!!!! If you do eat dog/cat food, you must also have a dog or cat!!!! Tell me then????? Do you smear wet dog/cat food on your clitoris to persuade your animals to engage in sexual deviances of your nature???? Or maybe you don't prefer dog/cat food.... Maybe you use PB because it sticks better and stays in the same spot as you lay and spread.....

AMEN TO THAT!! Where have all the stand up bass, steel guitars, and fiddles gone? We need Waylon, Hank, and Haggard back on them stages, not this pop/rock broke up with my boyfriend let me write a song crap. Traditional Country needs to be restored. Mark my words keep a look out for miss Madelyn Victoria from Texas, she is gonna bring it back. As of now she sings her originals which have all been driven by inspiration from nothing but the best, Strait, Haggard, Patsy Cline, Willy, Brooks & Dunn, and her favorite Mr. Johnny Cash. I definitely concur Traditional Country will make a come back!!!

1) I notice you have changed the subject from your false assertion.\r\n2) The proper response when you make a false statement is to apologize, not to change the subject.  You asserted that I only support far-left sources, when in fact my sources were from NASA, EPA, National Academies, NOAA, etc.\r\n3) Unsupported assertions are not facts. You make a lot of claims, but offer no evidence.\r\n4) Your new assertions are also unsurprisingly unsupported by fact, and the implication is contrary to fact.\r\n\r\nThe science of global warming goes back more than 150 years.  Scientists have studied global warming under Carter, Reagan, Bush 1, Clinton, Bush 2 and now Obama have been pretty consistent.  The vast majority of the actual climate scientists who are doing the actual climate science accept global warming.  \r\n\r\nYOU are the one who rejects evidence out of hand - without having the least understanding of it.

Tatum - "I guarantee you the world's leading meteorologists, of which you are not one, are more concerned about climate fluctuations in the last 100 years than they are concerned about what happened during the Ice Age. That's why I made that joke. What happened 20,000 years ago has no bearing on what's happening now, at least in that sense."\r\n\r\nI notice that you jumped back to our climate 20,000 years ago as though it were a static entity while totally ignoring the 20,000 years of climate patterns since then. I didn't say look at the weather as it was 20,000 years ago; rather, I said look at the weather over the past 20,000 years (or 2000 years, or 200,000 years--take your pick). Examine the weather over the past 2000 years, 20,000 years, or 200,000 years and see how it has fluctuated over extremely long periods of time.\r\n\r\n"Minute changes over long periods of time are one thing, but rapid changes in a small period of time (and the possible reasons for them) is another."\r\n\r\nAnd we haven't had rapid changes in climate before, as in well before the industrial revolution?\r\n\r\n"As for your "Atlantic coast" lunacy, I'm fairly certain denizens of Miami have been more threatened by hurricanes in the last 100 years than those in Hoboken."\r\n\r\nYou do realize that you're the one defining the Atlantic Coast for me? I never said that the Atlantic Coast includes only the southern seaboard states of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia. You read that definition into my words and then blamed me for saying it. So now who's spouting your "Atlantic coast lunacy"? (IOW, I already know that the Atlantic Coast includes everything from Maine to Florida, and that was the definition from which I posted.)\r\n\r\n"Or maybe you're the kind of person who really does need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows?"\r\n\r\nNo, you just need to learn how to read.

I've been downsized but I have 2 jobs to pay my bills. So three times in the last 10 years, I have dated men who eventually quit because of reasons we all go through... "the boss is a jerk", "I hate this job", "my co-workers are idiots and I do all of the work". And they quit with no other income. Then didn't look for work and didn't do anything around the house. Unfortunately nice guys take the heat for the others who aren't so nice. So yeah- I'm not interested in you unless you can take care of yourself. Crappy economy or not. It's cold, but I don't expect  you to pay for me if I don't have a job either. I'm not asking for the Taj Mahal here. Maybe McDonalds every blue moon though.

Brit probably s a pretty good cheerleader to others but needs someone to be a cheerleader to her. Your OBSERVATION  is superficial look deeper."  \r\nThank you I will. \r\nI probably should have elaborated on that point a little.  I appreciate your comment and agree that is one way to look at it.  However, it's a known fact in sales,  if you don't believe in a product  when you're trying to encourage others to believe in it's usefulness, chances are you're not going to make a sale.  Britney has been very kind to the ones she's mentoring, but her discomfort and lack of confidence in herself still comes through.  Another way to think of it though, it's okay to show vulnerability and still be able to function.  The fact that Simon has to keep reassuring her and she keeps working on it and pushing ahead, is a good example for her group also.  Just an opinion.  Many ways to look at it.  Thank you for your input.

Mr. Romney was not stating that he could relate with those who were "cleaning up" after the storm.  He was drawing a comparison as how we can all do what we can to assist those affected by this storm.  We can't do everything to solve the problems, but we do what is in our power to do.\r\n \r\nHe stated that football game clean up crew felt overwhelmed when they first surveyed the job before them, but as each person took one lane and cleaned it the task wasn't so daunting and by each person doing a smaller portion of the task the job did get done.

Unfortunately you may be right on this premise. The tragedy is that the electorate is grossly ignorant of the economic realities that determine the longer term economic health of our nation. The short term indicators you are using to spin for Obama plausibly claiming improvements in the economy are laughable to any reasonably informed person. I do however accept the fact that most of our populace are uninformed about the consequences of our debt, excessive regulations, projected layoffs, 14% real unemployment and corporations projections for reduced capital spending under another Obama presidency.\r\nWhen nearly half of current college graduates are unable to balance a checkbook correctly, cant define the source of capital formation or accurately descibe how the market works, it is no wonder people on a large scale buy into the superficial indicators you reference.\r\nEveryone would be much better served by listening to Steve Wynn, Mort Zucker, Ken Lagone, the presidents of Caterpillar, John Deere etc, etc. than opinion writers and talk show hosts in the tank for Obama. These are the peope with the most factual and credible insights on where weare and where we are headed.\r\nRECOVERY-WHAT RECOVERY?

I'm seeing more and more stories about people losing it due to Sandy complications. I hate to blame victims here, but a little preparedness and common sense could have gone a long way. \r\n  \r\n1. Millions were told to evacuate as early as a week before the storm hit. Many didn't, or couldn't, and are now complaining about poor response by the Government and long lines at gas stations. It's not the Government's fault, there's only so many responders and repair personnel, and everyone is doing the best they can. Maybe you should have listened or prepared yourself a little better.  \r\n  \r\n2. Power is still out to much of the affected area, which means ATMs, debit cards, credit cards, etc are useless. It's a cash purchase environment. \r\n  \r\n3. For those who decided to stay and didn't stock up on essentials, I don't know what to tell you. When the power goes out and you have no flashlight, no water, and a bunch of food that requires a microwave to prepare, I have to question what was going through your mind in the days prior to the storm. \r\n  \r\n4. Stop walking around in the flood waters. There's no telling how much industrial and human waste you're wading through.  \r\n  \r\n5. As desperation becomes worse, so will human behavior. No matter how much New Yorkers like to pride themselves on pulling together in times of crisis, humans always have and will always be self preserving creatures first. Pulling a gun on someone in a long line for gas is pretty mild compared to how people will be acting if the power stays out for a few more days.

I know many people who work at ACO's and pounds.  They do care.  There is no excuse for this, though- it was inexcusable and the people whose fault it is need to be held accountable and removed from their positions.  Want to see animals treated better?  Tell idiots to stop adopting animals if they don't think it is a lifetime commitment.  Then there will be no need for shelters, rescues or pounds.  Until breeders stop breeding to make money, owners start spaying and neutering their pets BEFORE they reproduce, and only commited owners adopt we will always have animals being mistreated, neglected and abandoned.

Jack - you seem a bit bitter.  I have more education than my husband, and I do pay all of our credit card bills (eating out, his clothes, my clothes, our daughter's clothes).  I also pay for health insurance, the cars, daycare etc.  He covers the morgage, utilities, and our saving.  I don't think that we're that far off from most duel income families.  It is all OUR money. \r\n  \r\nMen often end up paying more because they generally out earn their wives even if they both work full-time. \r\n  \r\nBTW - When I was single, I tried going dutch on dates.  Things didn't go well when I did it on a first date.  I eventually learned to let him pay for the first, and then I'd be responsible for the second.

A fed chief can only be fired by displaying gross imcompetence.  Given that smart money and most economists that aren't politically motivated have been praising his actions.. that's not going to happen. \r\n  \r\nI don't blame Bernanke for not wanting to go again in 2014.  He's done an amazing job, guided us through what could have been a depression.. and he's villified for it. \r\n  \r\nMore interestingly, he's villified by the GOP for doing exactly what Milton Friedman (Reagan's unofficial advisor) would have said to do.

Is this trend the result of the epidemic of single mom households? Girls see that men abandon them, they are unreliable, they are not necessary, single moms get rewarded and entitlements for their lack of good judgment with a partner.  Boys do not have a father figure,  they grow up lacking in ambition believing a woman like their mom will always take care of them, and with our society slanted to thinking women are exceptional to men, not equal, well the men know things are stacked against them, why push themselves.

People!!!  This man is so far out of reality it's downright scary.  I do truly fear for our country if he is elected.  Whoever thought McCain and Palin would look so inviting?  I used to think Romney was just  rich and arrogant.  Now I think he's mentally deficient.   Hope voters in these hard-hit storm states remember his stand against FEMA and are able to clean up their own lane.

So, let the huggers hug...Stay in your bubble and leave the "lovers" of this world alone. Love will save us and I chose to be part of that process... So far so good. I am fifty three, retired with a loving husband, close friends and plenty of money. Is it all about hugging? Absolutely not, but, I have found physical affection very healing.  \r\nThere is a conditon in medicine which is called "skin hunger". It happens when people are not touched. This is a particular problem among hospital patients. If \r\nyou don't believe this, check the research. Babies die when they are not touched. \r\nIt is called "failure to thrive" another medical condition. Look it up. You might learn something. Infectious diseased are amongst us all the time. You are exposed to colds etc whether you touch another person or not...We wonder why there are so many people who can't maintain relationships, so much sexual dysfunction and  mindless violence...

I live in NM and I must say the peasant mentality here is something to behold. This is why we are now the poorest state in the US.  The mexicans run this state and everybody in it.  Corruption is out of control on the local and state level.  These are the same mexicans supporting illegal immigration.  This is the same bunch of liberals Hussein Obama supports.

He already reniged on his campaign legalization promises, when Mexico complained about adverse affects on their profit margins, he started his nationwide clamp down on medical marijuana, shutting clinics nationwide. Mexico has legalized all personal use of all drugs as of 2009, President Calderone addressed the US Congress on his nation's concern that the US might legalize personal marijuana use, without disclosing that his contributors' incomes are based on contraband smuggling to the US. Big O knows how to butter bread.

Again ... another "story" --- yes it really was that way .. the law has recently changed and the unions in Chicago at places like McCormick and others are no longer required to build, set-up or "plug-in" anything. Vendor may do everything start to finish if they so chose. Again .. not saying it wasn't that way but if you're going to state information in an argument, it should probably be current information not history

Interesting, no mention that the ADP numbers for adding new jobs was done on a new method of calculation.  And, no mention of seasonal part-time help.  Hmmmmm, and right before the election too.  I wonder why?  And the market moves up on hope?  Again, at 13,000, the market is overvalued on a pure value basis.  This is really a 9,000 -10,000 market.  Sooner or later it will get there.  Gee, I hope that doesn't happen right after the election.  That would show what really has happened over the past 4 years.

But hey, that's your M.O. \r\n Did you notice that he went to show his mug with Republican Christie, but didn't even show his face in New York? Ya, no "Playing" there!    The difference is, Romney isn't in charge YET.\r\n Congratulations to "Team Catastrophe in Chief"! 456 days since he was elected, and he's "Looked Presidential" for 3 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dear "Youve" \r\n The separation of church and state referred to only extends to the church or the state - not the person performing her civic duty. The fact that she was there to vote and she was not WORKING there - means she was protected by the first amendment - freedom of speech. She has the right to express her views - you have the right to look the other way. \r\n The fact that she was not wearing a Vote Obama or Romney or anyone else means that she was not electioneering.  \r\n and BuddaDon - Mormons are not Christian (their Christ is a different one ( he is the brother of Satan) than the Christ of the New Testament (Son of GOD) which the Christians follow). They are good people, no doubt about that. Family oriented. But in the grand scheme of things - that doesn't count when they eventually leave this planet.

My example ignores nothing.  The article is listing the worst types of credit cards.  The people who use these credit cards fall under the category of "people who don't understand how to use credit cards properly."  The credit cards listed in the article penalize the people who were dumb enough to apply for them and use them. \r\n  \r\nWhy would anyone complain about a card with high fees when there are many cards out there that offer lower and often times zero fees?  It's ignorance plain and simple.

u said it ktwhw, its all about cycles, ive been saying that to a lot of people for about 4 or 5 years now. yes flare ups from the sun have been increasing and because of that it is warming up our planet, not the people who inhabit it. \r\nand the whole evolution thing, i have just one question, where is the proof we came from a tiny single celled organism? shouldn't there be somewhere in the world where evolution is still in the making? half tadpole half man maybe? oh there isn't\r\nGod is our creator that is how we came about not some tadpole

I love Hunter Hayes and Carrie Underwood. Not a fan of "Blown Away". It just doesn't appeal to me personally. That doesn't mean Carrie stinks or the song does. I think Blake, Miranda, Kenny, Tim and many others are still "Country". I just think the "old style country" with it's twang is more akin to Bluegrass now. I love Willie but (like Bob Dylan) have trouble actually enjoying his vocals. Taylor Swift's lyrics annoy me. She seems like Country's Katy Perry...They both bother me but obviously millions of people do like them. I just change the station when I hear them or see them. It's all a matter of personal taste and people seem to feel the need to be "haters" as Z from Texas said...just makes them look petty and small.

Country fan, everyone is entitled to their opinion and there is no need to be so nasty. I agree that most of the music last night was not what we traditionally think of as "Country" and that the genre has changed. I don't particularly care for it but I understand that there are others that do.  I don't like Rap or Hip-Hop either but respect the art and the opinions that are different from mine.\r\n \r\nI don't think most of the posts were saying that the artists can't sing and I didn't see anyone that said they could do a better job. People do just not like the change to more "modern" or "commercial" music under the Country banner.\r\n \r\nIt takes all kinds to make this world turn and just because someone disagrees with my views doesn't make them wrong, just different from me!

"The REAL reason small business does not hire is because of lack of demand due to low consumer confidence-- up to now anyway. Uncertainty via Omabacare and the Fiscal cliff hasn't got a DAMNED thing to do with it."\r\n \r\nYou just don't get it. Small business isn't hiring because big business is doing what small business is doing and using YOUR investment dollars to undercut costs. I run TWO businesses. I don't need new employees as much as I need stability in my conduits of facilitation. Give me stable ways to grow and I do. HealthCare isn't an issue at all. Administrators where they don't belong and causing havoc is one. Product has a base cost. I can name FIVE major retailers selling it for less than they bought it for and got it shipped to them. Every sale is a loss. Quarterly financials say they are making profit. That has nothing to do with Obama, it has everything to do with a glass ceiling and Ivy League blockade. YOU ARE KIDDING YOURSELF to believe the numbers and not do a little bit of resaearch to validate what they say. YOU are about to lose it all. Mine is in product that people use and will continue to need. I bought it and still do for pennies right off the retail floor. Cheaper than I can buy it wholesale. If you have ONE DOLLAR in the stock markets, you are in too deep. BTW... a consumer doesn't need confidence. He needs product when he wants it. No big box can promise it will be there when needed. If Wall Street smokes you long enough, you start to believe what they use in lieu of Reality is reality. It isn't.

Be careful what you wish for ladies.  For decades you complained about wanting men to be more like women and now we see a dynamic/byproduct of lower libido and bitchiness.  Men are expected to work a full time job then after work immediately help around the house like cook and clean while taking care of the baby.  This is not even close to being fair but rather a sad punishment for the actions of men in the distant past.   \r\n  \r\nWonder why so many men don’t want to have kids?  The smarter and more involved they are the less likely they want to have lots of them.  They take it seriously and know the time and money involved.  In the past men were able to come home to a clean house with the kids all taken care of.  Being a father back then was a joy ride.  Now men have to do more and women wonder why this is happening?   \r\n  \r\nAdd to that the sermonizing that being obese is normal and his needs are trivial.  Like so many women posted “get over it” but strangely this never applies to women’s needs.  She can become the size of an ox and claim she might have gained “a few pounds” in her defense is so mainstream it’s barely a cliché.  How selective and typical.  I am not complaining because at this rate it might slow the human population growth, at least in this country.  Other countries laugh at this nonsense. \r\n  \r\nDont wuss out, put a reply with your scores of thumbs down.

He should apologize to the American people and admit that he is not competent to lead this great country and resign. We must have big changes in the United States if we are to survive. And he is leading us down a road to total disaster. The Libya mess is just one of the messes he has caused but it was uncovered because of the election where most are covered up and stay covered up by the Main Stream Media. He needs to step aside and go back to his calling; a community leader in Chicago the home of Al Capone.....

After 4 years of lying, vacationing, bowing before kings of other nations, putting our country down to every country, not getting close to our allies, now changing the phrase "from the president of the united states and a grateful nation, we present this flag in honor of your husband's service" to "from the secretary of defense and a grateful nation"..., I have no respect from a President that doesn't even want to be associated with our FLAG, much less the people of the nation he promised to protect.  He has not accomplished anything he campaigned on. He has taken our Social Security that we, ourselves paid into for our retirement or disability to now call it a Federal Benefit fund.  It's no wonder our social security will run out in a few years. It was never meat to be used for anything other than the people that paid into it. So if it is a FEDERAL anything, it's going to go broke.He believes in abortion- even FULL TERM abortion- that's murder folks, anyway you look at it. This man is not the man that should sit in the President's chair. PLEASE DO NOT VOTE THIS MAN BACK AGAIN. We can't afford him.

The whole $16 Trillion went to those closed-bid contracts Dubya created and gave to his campaign donors from TEXAS. He never paid bills when he was Prez, left it for Obama. Only a total idiot makes an accusation like that with ill-gotten dollars stuffed in his pocket. Go home, Texan... wait for the Mexican and American armies to converge on you.

Agree, do your homework better before posting something like that. Yes, the Medicare surtax for 2013 exists, but it will not come into play for the 99% of Americans. The GOP is playing an awful lot of obfuscation games right now to bamboozle a few last minute votes.\r\n \r\nI have won the last 8 presidential elections where the guy I voted for last was elected. Early voting in 2012 I am with Obama, and I am predicting 9 in a row next week. There is going to be an awful lot of eyes on Ohio next week and voting machine impropriety by Tagg Romney and his associates. It made me a little ill today to see Karl Rove calling 279 electoral votes for Romney. For those that arent quite that certain on Romney but are planning to vote for him, please know you are not only voting for Romney you are voting for GOP management including controversial figures like Karl Rove and others. Consider your vote carefully before supporting this management team back into Washington, is 2008 that long ago that people have truly forgotten how the world fell apart that fall and Bush had to go on TV to pretty much admit that? Yes, Obama has faults but the Republicans do as well, don't be gulled by Romney and his insistence he is a better business manager. He made most of his wealth by adroit tax avoidance skills, inheritance and business cannibalization and outsourcing. Do we need more outsourcing overseen by the POTUS? Do We?

RBS is a credit card that you should stay away from.. but I applied for one and the original application which (I made copies to prove it), was 7.99 % FIXED. FIXED means it does not change, it was great for the first six billing cycles then the rate jumped to 17% so I disputed it with the CFPB (Consumer Finance Protection Bureau) another worthless agency set up by the current administration funded by our tax dollars. they did nothing, as well as the office of the comptroller. they are all crooks I will pay it off never ever to do business with them again... as far as the CFPB goes get rid of it too! worthless if it's disfunctional close it down. same with the office of the comptroller. shut 'em down save the tax payers money..

Just because a woman has more education does not mean she's going to make more money than her man. I have a college degree and my does not but he still makes more money than I do. So this notion of  men "marrying up" is an illusion.

Yeah...well said from a immature standpoint.  Reckon with all of your "toys" and the real expense in having/operating them for "real fun" you would need  to purchase a cheap, bland vehicle to compensate. But that is also a contradiction in itself too, actually a lie as almost ALL rice scrap cost as much or MORE than comparable vehicles that are two times better. Many adult people don't desire or need all that "toy" BS to impress others or entertain and satisfy an inner childish desire. They would rather have something worthwhile with better taste, quality, style, reliability and performance to indulge and enjoy themselves in. That doesn't mean owning a saki burner. And that also does not mean spending time and money in the repair shops as you would with that "other junk" you constantly praise and preach about. You should pound sand in japan...that is what they built their nuclear plants on.

Actually.. this story is complete bull plop.  I just caught an interview with someone at the base.  What actually happened was: \r\nThe Quick Response Team was ready in 24 minutes.  The Team Leader was getting antsy, and was to to go when he felt like he was ready.  He left shortly thereafter along with some militia.  They tried to get some heavy machine guns along the way, but that didn't happen.  They ended up getting to the consolate and extracted the staff that was outside.

You will never see that story, Obama has just bought a $40 million dollar estate in Hawaii and, I for the life of me can not account for where he got that money. Can you, if so please tell me. To me it looks bad, maybe kick back. All of you Obama supporters please enlighten me. How did he accrue forty million dollars of expendable income, on a salary of $400 Thousand a year. Really I am just courious.

Jason Aldean was robbed of the entertainer of the year award!! He clearly deserved that title after the year spent out on his 'My Kinda Party' tour. He put out a lot nightly to perform nightly for sold-out crowds and the release of his recent CD definately put him at the top of that list. He is a kick-**** entertainer...I am very disappointed this award went to Blake.

One more thing and I'll shut up.  If she's a single Mom, why did she eat at a place with these types of prices, she should have taken the kids to Carl's Jr's or Burger King instead, would have been less than five percent of what she paid, seems more like she took a boyfriend to dinner and paid the tab when  the bum said he forgot his wallet, we've seen it happen many of times.

Actually my point was that this woman has spent a lot of money trying to have a child and now that she has one she is too consumed with her work and how she looks than to participate as a mother.  At least the mothers on 16 and pregnant  spend time with there children and the show has provided the income for them to be stay at home moms with their children and provide better for their children. So although I don't think it should be glorified the parents are on theses shows are obviously doing a better job than this hack of a "egg donor." And further more obviously she is the one consumed with sex ... ”I’m trying to wrap my mind around how to juggle work and a baby. I fear [that] I’m going to be one of those women that has a baby, and the next thing I know, I’m walking around all day with a side ponytail, eating chips and wearing flip-flops and not wanting to be sexy for my husband. I don’t want the baby to be an excuse.” \r\n When you are a mother the first thing that should be your concern is your child not how you look or being sexy.  \r\n Are you still hoping that your opinion matters to me?

In New York City and some parts of New York State, traffic violations are being heard in the Traffic Violation Bureau, in short, TVB.  A jurisdiction passed by the NY  State Legislature.  It is useless fighting your tickets in this court.  The judges are lawyers, so called Administrative law judge, not a real judge.  These judges are stone faced, crude and merciless.  No lawyer can win any cases.  The only thing you get on using a lawyer in this TVB is just lower the fine or points or avoid suspension.

The analogy serves Romney's idea that the federal government should not provide assistance after a natural disaster (or almost any other time).  If every little church and community organization just "cleaned one lane," the whole problem would be solved.  \r\n Of course while a group of church volunteers can help you fill a dumpster with the sodden remains of all your earthly goods, I'm not sure how they're going to make out with flooded subway tunnels.  Bucket brigades, I suppose.

It's high maintenance to want to like the ring you're going to be wearing for the rest of your life? I'm very low maintenance (honestly!), but I wanted to pick out my own ring.. if I'm going to be wearing it forever, I want to make sure I like it! My husband & I shopped for my ring together, when I finally found a couple that I liked, he proposed without a ring, told me "you can choose between x & y" and I got to go when he bought it and pick out my own diamond, which was pretty neat. That probably won't work for everyone but it worked for our relationship.

I haven't watched AI since Adam Lambert lost to Kris Allen.  The only reason we hear about Adam Lambert now is because of the stunts he pulls every once in awhile, but I did like his voice a lot better.  No one even hears a peep out of Allen.  I always thought that one was fixed.  So, I stopped watching it.  Besides, once Paula left,  while Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined the show, it lost its credibility all together.  I do like the X Factor, though.

We make fun of the Asian countries for their strict school policies and curriculum. However, their students dominate over the US in pretty much every subject except social skills (hugging, kissing, provocative dress, teen pregnancy, STD's, etc.). Their students are ALL bilangual by the age of 12 and have the mathematical equivalency of our college students! So while we fight for our kids to be allowed to hug in school rather than focus on their education, our nation falls farther behind in every generation. While the graduates in Asia are taking whatever jobs they desire, we are hugging under a bridge somewhere and blaming the President.

"Which is precisely my point.  If you want fun with a Honda or Toyota, you have to buy a used one."\r\n\r\nI am sure they will put out some good ones soon, and the FR-S is a great start.  The new Lexus coupe looks promising too.  The Scion tC and the Civic Si are available now and are each a very fun car to drive.  New or used, Honda and Toyota do provide a few fun cars.\r\n\r\nI haven't had the privilege to test drive a CR-Z (at a time in my life that I really NEED a back seat), but from what I have heard Honda has accidentally recreated the first generation Austin Healey Sprite.  It IS slower than almost anything on the road (the original Sprite had a whopping 46HP) and makes absolutely zero sense on paper.  However, from behind the wheel it's actually very entertaining to drive.  Again, this is solely from reviews that I have seen so take it with a grain of salt but I am not entirely dismissive of the CR-Z

On the one hand, when have EPA mileage figures EVER been correct?  And these 'errors' are by only 1 or 2 MPG?  Second;  by the mere fact that Hyundai and KIA ARE coming forward voluntarily with this and offering compensation is why every potential buyer of a new economy car today SHOULD buy a Hyundai or a KIA.  You think Toyota, Honda or Nissan would have shown the same transparency?  No way!  They would have sicked their lawyers on it to spin the story into a complete coverup.  Hyundai and KIA are the best-made econocars and the best value on the market today.  If you've a brain in your head, you'll buy one!  This story demonstrates the favorable ethics that these two automakers have.  Good for them!

Gvillejake.. grouping people together happens to be the specialty of some Christian sects who never give an ear to another person's beliefs either. Not all Christians are being ridiculed - only those who don't have the capacity to really show a Christian spirit.. \r\nP.S.  I can't speak for others but I personally HAVE looked into their beliefs..

At the after school program here there was a girl who hugged so hard she left bruises. Rather than outlaw hugging they worked with her to show her what was appropriate. Problem solved. I'll never forget what happened a couple years ago with the guidance counselor at my girls school. End of day, we pass the counselor on our way out and my daughter goes up to give her a hug. The counselor pushed away my 6 yr old kid and demanded "Did you ask PERMISSION to hug me first?!". This woman gave my daughter a hug every single time she saw her for crying out loud. My child was devestated and I realized how insane the schools have become over this.

The reason the bags are "free is because they are already added into the ticket price. I like southwest and all but you can pay over $200 for most of their flights. airlines such as Allegiant you can pay for just a seat on the plane nothing else. If you want to take a bag you can pay but their most expensive flight I have seen was $215, add $35 for a bag and it is still cheaper.

I've lived in Las Vegas for over 40 years! The articles written over the years by reporters who have NEVER lived here crack me up!? They were so, so bad decades ago- and the way LV is presented in TV shows etc...so small, so carnival, so cheap....and today it's just a tiny smidge' better!  \r\nThings to know: 1. The Strip is a very big street in LV, but it's only ONE street! \r\n2. Downtown and The Strip (LV BLVD) are two very different areas of town!\r\n3. Sure, you've seen hotels- you may even have what you feel are some 'big' ones in your city, especially if you live in a big city but trust me OURS ARE BIGGER, more beautiful, grander even down to the bathroom fixtures and the custom furnishings. LV hotels; the Icons have thousands of rooms and casino's, dining, walkways, entertainment, dance-clubs, pools and acres of lush landscaping as big as small towns.\r\n4. LV is surrounded by mountains and mountain/desert terrain and it's not very far in any direction and the amount of natural, outdoor areas of interest are vast, many and soaring...like Red Rock in one direction and Mt. Charleston in another, the Valley of Fire, Lake Mead etc...\r\nAnd don't forget that within every gigantic hotel on 'The Strip', there are many 'free things to do and see', just ask!\r\n\r\nBest of Luck-\r\nScott

It's archaic, and the person who wrote the article is reporting on a seriously flawed study.  Please take a look at my detailed comments above.  Traditional education approaches, along with the idea that someone is locked into an earning pattern based on whatever they'd accomplished by the time they left school is just silly. One of my brothers is your age, and has an Associates degree, but no more, because traditional education was pretty useless to him.  He's been happily and profitably working in the computer field since the early 1970s.  My husband is your age, and he sort of collects degrees because he's focused on intelligence training and education and works in that field.  He's a retired colonel (not collecting retired pay yet) and has two Masters and a PhD, along with assorted educational notches on his bedpost, but he probably earns less than you do.  He's happy doing what he loves, though, so I'm happy.  I have a Masters, and worked for many years as a military historian, but I'm not working 'outside' any longer, AND I'm older than he is.  He doesn't mind.  I'm currently making myself useful by editing our second book. (This one is on an intelligence analysis methodology he invented.)  Do I think I married "up"?  Silly question -- I love him and he loves me, up, down, and sideways. We've been through flush times and lean times together, but stay strong and happy because of our partnership.

@Idvoteforacamel- You can't buy American products anymore as they are all overseas! They only have to be assembled here now to be labeled "Made in America". Don't condone this abusive behavior by Corporations stating that they are a company and need to make money.  They make plenty of money and more, we don't see the savings, it just lines their pockets.  If you don't believe me...when Corporations started heavily leaving America in the late 80's did you notice a huge friggin price dip?!! Prices have only risen never gone down! It's logical to say we didn't see the difference...they did, hello! That was the beginning of the Mega Rich, there were a few families before that were that rich, now...it's paramount...not a coincidence.

And please, ladies, you CAN choose your own outfits.  Miranda Lambert seemed the Fattest Girl in Town and her line "I got a hankerin for gettin' into somethin'. That somethin" sure wasn't them pants!  Turned Hell on Heels into Ham on Heels.  Old Faith Hill rocked the look but left her voice back at Monday night football...she's a baritone now.  Taylor Swift, pretty and Zzzzzz. Thanks to the Bands Perry and Zac Brown for keeping it real. And whoever was mixing the sound, it's nice to hear the vocals.  Don't quit your day job.  Please Nashville, no more California country fried pop.

you republicans jus dont get it do you. no matter how much oil this country drills for it will always be sold to other countries who pay higher prices it does not come back to theusa and never has.  even  stating oil is cheap you are the first ones who scream when ga**** 4 dollars a gallon even though no goverment official has any control over the price of gas and if they did try to control it you republicans would be the first to scream socialist instead of free market. all new energy cost more to research and impliment only when it beome more  used does it become cheaper to make.  I do hope all you republicans show up for work on wensday after romney's bid for the white house fails. and I hope you will instruct your member of congress to actually do some work in the next 4 years unlike the last 4

I agree.  After 20 years of marriage, continually employed for all of those years, raising a family without any government aid - my wife berates me for being "boring, tired all the time" and "bitter".  All the while she adores her friends' husbands who are unemployed, hooked on drugs and/or otherwise scamming the system.  These "men" , according to her, are "spontaneous, fun-loving, carefree" people...

Jac - How can you possibly compare “settlers not eating” with a marathon?!?!?!  You could possibly compare the life on Staten Island right at this moment to being Pioneers having to build their entire lives back from scratch and their community back from scratch.  You do realize that the people most devastated by this catastrophe live on Staten Island and that most of those people are “Blue Collar”, police officers, fireman, nurses, etc. the people that would have to work overtime to assist the marathon.  Well I am pretty sure that those people would rather not work overtime at this moment in their lives!!!!!  Your analogy is so off base, that I am embarrassed for you allowing your self to think it and then type it.  You reek your immaturity and total lack of empathy.

To all Police and Troopers,\r\n \r\nWhen you say don't speed and you won't get a ticket, that means you too unless you have your siren and flashing lights on. I absolutely have a problem when a officer or trooper expects me to do the speed limit when they are not abiding by the laws they are enforcing. Why are you getting paid to break the law? Also, some cops lie.....Really? I was written a ticket for speeding and passing in a no passing zone......in no way shape or form was it me. You tell me what to do since the judge found me guilty because I could not prove it was not me? And I'm not supposed to be mad?

Under these circumstances, union membership should not be an issue.  Help is Help.  If Unions are so good that they refuse help from 'their neighbors", then they should deal with the irate citizens of the area.  This time the UNIONS are WRONG.  Period.

Although I agree that Country music has changed over the years one must understand that Country music audiences have changed as well. While man of us “older” music fans love the “old” sounds we don’t buy as many tickets to concerts or CD’s as we used to – so – Country music has evolved to give a “younger” audience what it wants – glitz, glamour and fla**** now less about the music and more about the visual stimulus. Can you really see Tammy Wynette packing Giant’s stadium in New York these days…the answer’s No but the truth of the matter is – Taylor Swift can and does almost every day! The Grand Ol’ Opry days of Nashville are over and have been slowly fading into the background for years. Country music isn’t going anywhere – It’s just not our grandparent’s music any more – Don’t like it…go get a George Jones or Waylon Jennings CD and cry in your beer!

Sorry...just don't like Taylor Swift...but the kids like her, buy her junk, which by the way all sounds alike, and that's what counts in the real world.  No, country isn't country any more...maybe we'll see a resurrection in the next few years.  Give me Strait, Nelson, Reba, Loretta, Jackson...and the rest.  I do like some of it...but the screaming doesn't cut it for me.  If I want to listen to pop or rock, I change stations.  I want to hear country when I want to hear country.  Just sayin'....

This is nature and what happens when men chase after women. If women chased after men then they would do worse at school and education. It is MUCH easier for a women because the man usually has to sacrifice to stay with that certain woman. They have to follow where ever it is she goes or moves to. Long distance relationships rarely work out so unless he wants to lose her HE HAS TO FOLLOW. Women will dump a man that will not chase after them or sacrifice. The man ends up working to pay the rent/bills while the women keeps going to school.\r\n \r\nThen the woman leaves that man after she is done using him and finds a new man that wants to chase after her. They stay together for 3-5 years until he stops chasing and she leaves again because she in now addicted to the feeling of being chased after. This goes on until the number of men chasing her goes down and she ends up with whatever she can get at that point. I wonder why there are so many divorces...50/50 my a$$. It is either the woman's way, or no way in this country atm.

Just another young person trying to come into their own, exploring and expanding upon their version of sexuality, while at the same time trying to fit in with this grossly messed up generation of limitless behavior freaks. Money doesn't change people. It just provides them the means to quickly become more of who and what they are, whether it be good or bad.

Had it....based on my observations, I think mileage posting seems pretty accurate...on the average. My honda accord beats both the city and hwy posted milegae, and I have noticed my RAV doesn't, but that is because the person that uses it is a very on and off throttle person, fast braker too. When I drive the RAV it does get the posted milage. \r\n  \r\nPerhaps you are an agressive driver ? Drive with low tire pressure, etc.

It's nothing to mess around with and you need a agressive safety program and record in this business.

I have worn them and I LOVE them.  They may be "hideous" but they are about the best pair of boots you can ever wear...especially in a cold climate like Minnesota.  I don't get why California dwelling celebrities wear them or why they don't overheat.  They are super warm and very comfortable.  I have had my pair for about 18 years and they still keep my feet super warm when I am out shoveling and playing in the MN snow.  They are finally starting to show signs of wear and I would love to own another pair and buy some for my daughter.  Perhaps the reason the sales are slumping is because they are priced ridiculously!!

i bought a deaership car with a clean carfax. i trusted them. after all how could they sell me a flood car? how wrong i was. you need to bring any car you buy to a trusted mechanic who knows what to look for. if the seller does not cooperate in any way just walk away from the deal and that dealership, period. there are plenty of dealers and plenty of used cars out there. DONT GET EMOTIONAL IN YOUR SELECTION. a decision and deal made on how much you "love" the car could be your worst nightmare later. always try to get a warranty. a few thousand mile or a few months warranty give you a lot more power to just return the car within 72 hours of the deal in most states. be aware your lender will not help you and the dealer will say you cant return the car. I MADE THESE MISTAKES but had the car inspected and it was an obvious flood vehicle after looking under the car. i notified every consumer and motor vehicle agency i could. i had a liscensed certified mechanic declare it unsafe and brought it back and thew th keys on the salesmans desk had a witness took pictures of everything including where i dropped it off with identifiers in the backround and dates on the pictures. the salesman said i cant do this its yours now you cant reverse the sale etc. and tried to make me keep it saying what can we do to make you happy. i said just take it back and forget about it over and over and left it there. one week later the loan dissapeared from the bank and the car was relisted for sale  a check for my deposit appeared in my mail. one thing i can say is i was very lucky to do this. it was the biggest dealer in tampa fl and they could have fought this but probably did not want to get the publicity that i told them i would create. i figure the car came out of hurricane irene from up north.CAR FAX DOES NOT HAVE PRIVATELY PAID REPAIRS ON IT SO HOW CAN YOU BE SURE< GET IT INSPECTED BY SOMEONE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

C'MON PEOPLE!!!!! The man had to have his leg amputated! If it was you that lost your leg then you would want compensated too. Think about how much his life will change? I was in Iraq for a few tours and got shot in the arm on my very last tour. After five surgeries they had to amputate my arm half way between my wrist and elbow. To throw fuel on the fire it got infected and they had to amputate 4 more inches 8 months down the road. The arm I lost was the left and it was my dominant hand. Trust me it changes your whole life!! If the bolts holding the statue up malfunctioned then I think he has a very legitimate lawsuit!

I thought the Awards show was fabulous!  I love the NEW sound of country music!  It makes you 'feel good' instead of wanting to cry in your pretzels!  It has great beats that are very easy to STILL line dance to and also two-step!  If you don't want to do either of those, then you can easily 'shag' or even fast dance to them!  It is very well-rounded and I totally love the sound and I am 61 yrs old!  The performances were awesome last night.  I think the only one that I didn't particularly enjoy was Faith Hill.  She sounds like she is struggling to sing anymore.  Sorry Faith and you have always been a fav of mine!  Carrie's song "Blown Away" is awesome and she is too!  Pontoon is my very favorite song and I was tickled that it won!  I love Blake and so glad the he and his cute wife won!  So it was a super night for me because some of my favs won awards and I got to hear all my fav songs!  Good Job as usual Brad & Carrie!  Ya'll were tops!

Another thing that I can't understand is how Schmitty can tell lie after lie after lie and the Republicans still trust him? He can tell you one thing,  only to change his mind the next day, yet Republicans still trust him. Is this the new  way Republicans would run the Country by saying one thing and let the people try to figure it out. Does this mean Robmey can say anything and he will be believed? The one thing that I could never stand was a liar and I bet if you were to look up liar you would see "Schmitt Robmey"\r\nLIAR = NO CONSCIENCE\r\nNO CONSCIENCE= NO SOUL

Get a debit card.  If you have no money in your bank account you can't buy anything.  No interest charge, no payments to make.  Just make bank deposits when you get the money if you plan on buying anything with the card.

I agree with rah 1956!  The only reason these bimbos got a show is that their parents, (well, their late father and step-father Bruce Jenner) are famous!!  Sad, but true.  They'll probably riding that gravy train until they die.  Unless...they finally grow up, and do something meaningful and constructive with their lives.  Any bets?

Wow...Had it rough growing up did we? If punching your kid or any kid in the face is better than carving into a turtle shell then you have some seriously ****ed up priorities. It's not like this kid was carving up his dog. It was a turtle shell. People have been doing this for over 400 years. It doesn't hurt the turtles as there are no veins or nerves in the shell so unless you're carving down to the meat, no harm/no foul.\r\n\r\nYou're clearly uneducated and backwards. I suspect it doesn't take much for you to want to hit a kid, I just hope your kids live long enough to make it out of the house before you **** them up too bad...Moron...

No, I do not believe drivers should not be compensated for total miles the automakers claim the vehicle will last.   If the manufacturer claims a vehicle should last 200,000 miles and the owner has driven it in the ground, by the way they drive, and the vehicle never makes it to 75,000 miles for example, they should be rewarded for a 200,000 mile claim? \r\n  \r\nI also think that only the original owner, whose decision to purchase was based, among other factors, on the rated MPG, should be compensated, not anyone after that.  And I'm not sure if another factor should be only if you still own the vehicle.  An original owner who unloads their vehicle after 10-12 years of ownership should be compensated somehow also. \r\n  \r\nHyundai and Kia might have been acting unfairly with their erroneous ratings but they are trying to right a wrong (probably only doing this to ease a reduction in sales).

One year my Mom handed out. "What are you kids doing out here! Get back in the House!" She thought the trick-or-treaters that came to our house were my sister and me and we were told not to leave the house because my parents were moving heavy machinery around and didn't want us to get hurt. I don't think we ever had another trick-or-treater again.

Cops are using their guns on people in wheelchairs, naked and un-armed, killing dogs on chains and now tasers on 10yr olds that do not obey them. Here in Missouri, a woman cop shot a small 4 pound dog about 4 or 5 times when she responded to a disturbance. The dog barked so she shot him 2 or 3 times. The dog barely made it back to his cage and the woman cop went to the cage and shot it 2 more times until dead. She said she was in fear of her life The dog was the size of a Yorkie or a little smaller. The owner begged her not to shoot, he said he will not bite or hurt you. It was a baby. Point being, cops are using their guns more often against defensless people and dogs no matter the size, more and more!! Cops are poorly trained and think they are god!!!! They use there guns at the drop of a hat or ( BABY DOG BARKing) I have lost all respect I used to have for the police!! Thank god it was a taser,but not any less stupid!! He should be fired and sued. Sounds like he was bullied in school and is an a** to his kids if he has any!!!!!!!! He is a poor excuse for a cop. By the way the woman cop that shot the Yorkie was fired and had to issue a public apology

I agree with Dan above.  This sounds very fishy, especially making a consistent 13% on your returns.  I guess maybe you weren't around when the dow dropped from 14K to 7K.  The average overall return for the last 10 years or so has been nearly flat, so claiming a 13% annual return on a mutual fund is bs.

I am 66 years old and I have bought few cars in my lifetime. I have never based my purchase on the gas mileage. Anyone that believes that is in for a surprise. I know that some cars will exceed the estimates but most will not. I base my purchase on reliability. I drive a 2008 Honda Ridgeline and it's the best truck I've ever owned. The gas mileage sucks though.

That's some good logic there.  Seeing as the transfer is supposed to just be a direct link up, and that obviously the idiot helping her was breaking the law.  So, by your logic, it'd be your own fault for being air headed and leaving your TV or other valuables laying about your house as anyone (who would be breaking the law), could break in and just take what they saw.  Then you'd have no-one but yourself to blame for not putting bars on your windows, dead bolts and stop bars on the doors, a canine guard, and ADT.  I'm not saying it was the brightest of things for her to do, but don't blame someone elses illegal behavior on the victim.

All the Mitt Romney voters just supported Mitt Romney and his Bain corporation associates as they just moved another company to China. Go to Bainport.com and read about this new venture capital Mitt Romney and his Bain associates have created for pure profit and how they forced these Bainport Illinois employees to train Romney's chinese imports to their jobs or face layoffs and firings before their December layoffs. Romney was so proud of his United States heritage that he and his Bain Associates forced the Bainsport company to take down the american flag while the chinese workers were there for the two weeks of training. Each and every republican/teaparty or whatever the hell they call themselves now completely support sending jobs overseas and raising the employment rate here in the United States. Be proud of yourselves Romney supporters.

In my personal experience, generalizations about women don't work. As a man who has been with a number of women, all of them beautiful, I have found no two alike in any way. I've seen beautiful faces and bodies containing shrinking violets, adrenaline junkies, introverts, extroverts, kind souls and cruel, vivavacious ones, depressed ones, greedy and generous ones, creative ones and mundane ones, sellers and those who self-promote like an ostrich with its head in the sand...and women I've known who were not as attractive had no better or worse likelihood of having any of those traits. With the admission that I am more likely to want to get to know the female who I think is the most beautiful one in the room, I balance that with the fact that guys are measured in all sorts of ways that aren't fair either.  \r\n  \r\nI agree with Van Man that many attractive women are disproportionately insecure about their looks, even when they demonstrably attract masculine attention. \r\n  \r\nOne generalization I will make: Whatever your appearance, I think if you are more accustomed to having things you value in life, you are less likely to ankle bite at those who look like they have it better. I wish I was better looking and more charming, but I hope I never say a bad word about a movie star, singer or athlete that women get worked up over. It would just make me look like a sore loser.

And besides that most of you waiters will put the tip in the total already when you pay with a cc. I know this because they have done it to me in places like the Olive Garden. So heads up you are already giving a tip with that so when you add some more that is just adding to what they are already getting from you for the service that is their job. Cashiers and others that are in the world of public service do not get tips so why should they? Just cause they have to put up with the same kind of people cashiers do everyday.

yes, full maturity is reach at age 14 for women and 16 for men. Only the men's law is that make this "so call minors laws". At that age , i was doing all of the above and 'being considerate a minor", but it did not stopped me, to do what i wanted, whom i wanted or where i wanted 33 years ago!.

What are parents intrested and involved in at their childs school?\r\nThe principal at a large inner city public school made this statement last year:\r\nOur school (High School) held an Open House one evening. All of our staff was available to meet and greet any parent or citizen intrested in learning about the school or their childs education. Seventeen people showed up for the Open House. Immediately following the Open House in an adjacent building was a boys basketball game. Over five thousand people attended the game to support their team.\r\n \r\nWho cares about the school as long as they can hug, grind at a school dance, and play sports! Are parents supporting the school and intrested in their childs education?

All of those things were important to Milton.  That has nothing to do with the company as it stands now.  If he wanted to be sure that continued, he should have left the company in trust with specific guidelines on how it was run. \r\n  \r\nIt is a publicly traded company whose sole (soulless) purpose is to maximize profits for it's shareholders.  Great men and women who care about the workers who make their products are becoming more and more rare.  Milton did all the things you mentioned and more, and he still managed to make a pretty good living for himself.  That's not good enough for most companies today.

I would agree but have to say she didn't give birth through her vagina, they sliced open her abdomen and yanked the poor baby out that way. Honestly, I think this is what turned the guy off, vaginal birth is much less traumatic than c-section.

And by the way.... All those Mammoths and Mastadons who drove those SUV's and cars around 10,000 years ago and caused those north american glaciers to melt should be written into the history books as criminals and we should remove all their skeletons from the museums because they caused global warming and passed it on to our ancestors who took up the cars and trucks and then made planes and built factories and caused all that global warming 10,000 years before any of us. They did it, they must have or the glaciers would still be around.. It had to be their fault that all those storms and volcano's and melting glaciers had to be their faults or they would still be present... At least according to Gore and His liberal followers reasoning that would be the only explanantion the world heated up and the glaciers melted.. Man did it 10,000 years first!

The Center for Disease Control has issued a warning about a new virulent strain of this old disease. The disease is called "Gonorrhea Lectim." It pronounced "Gonna re-elect em" and is a terrible Obamanation. The disease is contracted through dangerous and high risk behavior involving cranium up the rectum. Many victims contracted the disease in 2008. Most people, after having been infected during the past 4 years, are beginning to realize how destructive this sickness can become! \r\nGonorrhea Lectim is easily cured with a new drug on the market called "Votemout." The first dose should be taken now and the second dose in Nov. 2012. Everyone should be warned not to engage in this type of behavior again; otherwise, it could become permanent and eventually wipe out all life as we know it.\r\nPlease inform all those bright persons you love and really care about.

When Fox first broke this story this morning.

I did  find that the training needed to be a licensed elecctrician in Alabam is pretty thin...and New Jersey does  not have a reciprocal working agreement with them because of it...not sure about New York. That would be all they need to get some linemen hurt or killed...and have their states defending lawsuits and making payouts ...sorry but you have to be careful and keep your people safe...they've been through enough.

"Tatum - "I guarantee you the world's leading meteorologists, of which you are not one, are more concerned about climate fluctuations in the last 100 years than they are concerned about what happened during the Ice Age. That's why I made that joke. What happened 20,000 years ago has no bearing on what's happening now, at least in that sense."" \r\n  In the last 100 years, you say?  So that would exclude Hurricane Isaac, which made Houston the major gulf town in Texas rather than Galveston.  It would also exclude a HUGE forest fire in Canada that resulted in ash, darkness at noon, etc, well into the United States for many weeks or even months. (We know this latter fact from a vast number of diaries, letters, etc, that are in the LoC or National Archives.)  Shall I continue or are two refutations of your argument enough to al least slow down the polemics?

I have no problem with this show.  If it gets the rating, then fine.  Ultimately that is what is going to decide it--not some self-righteous tools bad-mouthing these people.  As far as I can see, these people are a wholesome family.  They are not putting stress on the public welfare system (octomom, eg);  They raise their kids with love and great values (unlike gosslins and kardashians); and their kids have not been any  trouble.  The parents work to provide; the kids do chores like all should; and they have a generally happy livelihood.  Got nothing to do with numbers.  I know of many number of people who grew up by themselves or with just one sibling, got to do "everything", and are all messed up.  If just numbers was the issue, then there shouldn't be any problems from families of 2-3 kids, right?

I place the blame squarely on the parents’ shoulders. Kids today are not taught to listen to and respect their elders, authority figures or even the police. Have the parents take a parenting class and learn how to raise a responsible young adult.

But Boston wasn’t quite ready to lose a full day of swing state visibility with a week left in the race. So, after some deliberation, the campaign decided to use their existing venue in Ohio to stage a makeshift, and nonpartisan, humanitarian project. It would be a way for Romney to show leadership — and get on the local news — without looking craven or opportunistic. \r\nThey weren’t willing to lose a day’s visibility in a swing state, so they came up with the event and crafted it in a way that would still get them political benefit, but would camouflage the intent.  So, as I predicted, Team Romney saw Hurricane Sandy – saw the imminent peril of tens of millions of Americans – as a political "oppotunity" to exploit.

Jay - as a previous poster pointed out, Fidelity's 8x number is low.  You should plan for at least 10 x or more.  I've done the math like other responsible people, and this is for real.\r\nIf you're making close to 100k and not saving much such that you won't even have 100k saved when you retire, well then you have no one to blame except yourself.  Fool.  Spend LESS and SAVE MORE.  Eating cat food in your retirement years will suck.

First and foremost, I am for hugging, yes even in all schools. That being said, I understand why even elementary schools ruled against hugging. It's due to constant bombarding of sex grounded eye wash all the way down to toddlers. I'm not against sex either, but come on people. Affection is a beautiful thing.

Flashoverman--guy, it's a trick question.  Nobody has precise temperatures for any section of the Earth dating back to 1512 in 10 year blocks.  It's kind of like asking what people's average weight was back in 1512, broken down by geographic region. Some data just doesn't exist.\r\n \r\nOne can take data from the Antarctic and extrapolate the temperatures--but nobody has the precise date.\r\n \r\nThis is one of those flat-earth kinds of question. It requires that people provide some sort of ridiculously precise and unavailable data because it doesn't like the information that is coming out of the scientific method. It wants historical fact when there isn't any (one way or the other).  PaxPax gave the perfect answer--there are clear issues having to do with climate change (he forgot to include the island countries that are ceasing to exist because the islands are being reclaimed by the sea).\r\n \r\nThe global warming types from the 1980s and 1990s were, in fact, being overly dramatic and alarmist. The chief guy has already admitted that. However, we are seeing smaller scale issues--chiefly erratic weather and changes to the oceans--which were predicted.  The worst-case scenario has not (yet--and I hope it stays that way) happened, but that doesn't mean we don't have issues.\r\n \r\nSeriously, guy--even the scientist hired by the Koch brothers who was seriously skeptical came to the conclusion, after well-funded studies, that this is a real issue.  Why can't you accept reality?  I can't see the wind, but I can see its effects--and that's enough for me.

If a woman puts her hand on a man to assault him... then she needs to be ready to have her A$$ kicked... If you are going to punch a man then that woman needs to be ready to be treated like a man.... and get her A$$ kicked... It is not okay to abuse any one whether you are a woman or a man..  In either case, whoever is being hit should have  the right to shoot the sh_it out of the person is doing the hitting!!!!!  AS MUCH **** AS MEN DO, WE AS WOMEN HAVE NO RIGHT TO PUT OUR HANDS ON THEM.... WOMEN ARE ALWAYS CRYING ABOUT HAVING MEN RESPECT THEM... WE HAVE TO RESPECT MEN AS WELL.  IF THINGS GET TO A POINT WHERE A WOMAN FEELS THAT SHE HAS TO PUT HER HANDS ON A MAN.... THAT RELATIONSHIP IS NOT WORTH HER BEING THERE..........LEAVE  ​  !!!!

This article's got it wrong.  "Regular, sugar-filled soda" isn't filled with sugar at all.  Not since the Coca Cola corporation discovered a cheaper chemical alternative, High Fructose Corn Syrup.  So regardless of which soda you drink in the US, you're getting a fizzy salt-water drink sweetened with chemicals.

Dont hate at people during a huge disaster. I lost everything in my life last year during a flood. I know what people are going through out on the east coast right now. You have to have fun and do stuff like this in a time of grief to take your mind off it to help pull thru. If you got a problem with it thats fine but they can still have fun when they lost lots.

You thumbs down a true statement!  Omega made a patently false statement which I corrected and all you can do is thumbs me down for stating the truth!  Do you guys not value facts at all?  \r\n\r\nHere's a website showing Al Gore's house in Montecito, CA:\r\nhttp://virtualglobet  ​ rotting.com/states/C  ​ A/Montecito/\r\n\r\nHere's the detailed information:\r\nhttp://virtualglobet  ​ rotting.com/map/al-g  ​ ores-house-2/\r\n\r\nThat site gives the following lat / lon:\r\n\r\n\r\nCopy that into a google search bar and it should bring up the location in google maps.  Zoom out.  From that ALONE you can see it's at least 2 Km from the beach.\r\n\r\nThere's an application called GoogleEarth which I highly recommend, but you have to install it on your computer.  If you do that, copy-paste the lat / lon into the search bar for GoogleEarth.  It will automatically zoom to that location.  You can see that the elevation for it is 511 ft. ASL (ASL=above sea level)\r\n\r\nIt's zoomed in too far, so zoom out until you see the coast.  Click on the ruler in menu bar.  Click and release the mouse over the coastline approximately closest to the house.  Move to the house (marked with a pin), click again.  go to the little popup menu that currently reads about 2 miles and change the display to kilometers.  It reads 3.25 Km. \r\n\r\nSummary:  house is 2 miles as the crow flies from the coast and 500 feet ASL.\r\nConclusion: What the original poster typed is bullcr@p.  What I typed in response is fact.

There is NEVER a good reason to go into debt, which is what your doing with each and every credit card purchase. Get rid of all your cards, save up a 6 month emergency fund, get rid of all your debt, and (this may sound radical) ONLY BUY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD !! (i.e., actually have the money IN HAND to pay for!!) The "Credit Score" should be renamed the DEBT SCORE. The only reason you need a credit score is to go further into DEBT. Why, people, WHY ?!?! Act like an adult, put off the "I gotta have it now" mentality, and run your finances like your grandma would. If she didn't have the money, she didn't buy it.

Surely any lawyer with his head screwed on would pursue denying the claim as an act of god! That could spark a huge religious war.\r\nCan you still believe in an almighty existence aftr somthing like that. God saying "Well I cured your wife of cancer, now you have to pay, it'll cost you an arm and a leg though".  Should have read he small print. I'm sure all religious people will find only the positives in this. He had to pay for one amazing deed.... so his selfless deed resulted in him having to suffer someway...not very christian? Or is that the christian way?\r\nPerhaps people will say that god actually saved him from dying instead or make some reason to make it sound like god was being wonderful. The irony in this is amazing.....

I will submit the radically simple thesis that Hitler's appeal to Germans was much as the name of his political party would suggest -- a heady brew of rather extreme Leftism (socialism) combined with equally extreme nationalism -- with Hitler's obsession with the Jews being a relatively minor aspect of Nazism's popular appeal, as Dietrich (1988) shows. There were nationalist Leftists long before Hitler (Napoleon Bonaparte for one) -- as is shown at length (PDF) but the usual "all men are equal" dogma of the Left and their Marxist belief in the all-important role of social class usually inhibited 20th century Leftists from being really keen nationalists. Hitler felt no such inhibitions. His "Ein Volk" dogma in effect very cleverly substituted the usual leftist dogma with "All GERMANS are equal" -- and also, of course, superior to non-Germans. \r\n\r\n And Hitler's nationalism did have the very great appeal of being at least apparently heartfelt. Right from the earliest chapters of Mein Kampf Hitler's love of his German nation (Volk) stands out. And that his constantly expressed love of his people and belief in their greatness should have earned him their love and belief in return is supremely unsurprising.

This is complete and utter BS. They're in, what? 5th or 6th grade? There is nothing wrong with hugging someone. Next they're gonna suspend someone because their mother or father gave them a goodbye kiss.

Everything lyin Willardo feeds his braindead followers is a myth. I am sure he would be doing better if he told these repuke dopes that he would create 50 million jobs in the next 4 years. They don't need to be told how. \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo should not even be running for president. But for a lyin moron, talk is cheap. This clueless moron has no idea how to fix anything. This criminal repuke bankupts companies and loses jobs. What a joke. The nuts that follow him actually believe that he is going to create 12 million new jobs and these dopes believe him. He does not have to tell them how, that does not matter. \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo is known as the slapped axx Mexican Mormon Moron for good reason. This complete dunce made himself look even more ignorant than he already is by stating in a campaign clip that if he ever overpaid his taxes, he does not deserve to be your president. Well this repuke dunce overpaid his 2011 taxes by $3,000 to make it look like he was paying a higher tax rate-which he can recover after the election. He has up to 3 years to refile an amended return. Only a pathetic, psychotic, braindead radical right wing cracked teanut dope will vote for him.

They had an episode on "Everybody Loves Raymond" where Frank was giving out candy, ran out, and thought the condoms in the kitchen cabinet were gold-wrapped "candy coins" an d handed those out. \r\n  \r\nI can watch those over and over. My MIL is just like Marie crossed with Mother Soprano, although FIL was a great guy. They are also only a few neighborhoods east of Lynbrook. They wondered why we moved 1/2 hour away and we probably w/h gone further east except for the commute into our Manhattan jobs.

I cannot believe how stupid most of these posts are!  Children used to be employed, there was no such thing as a "weekend" let alone an 8 hour work day, decent pay, etc., etc., that people died, DIED, for us to have now.  Do you know how many union workers were killed in the 20th Century for merely trying to join together to have collective bargaining power?  Thousands!!!  I don't understand the lack of critical thinking skills, absence of knowledge of history, and apparent masochism displayed in most of the remarks to this article.  If our country is as full of people as stupid as and or as wilfully ignorant as the people who responded here, then we are doomed.  No thanks for taking me down with you!

GoBlue here is some good info conditions during that time period were similar to today. \r\n  \r\nPacific Ocean Cooling Atlantic Warming  Reoccurring Natural Phenom \r\n  \r\nwww.pnas.org/content  ​ /101/12/4136.abstrac  ​ t   *U.S. Geological Survey, Denver Federal Center, MS 412, Denver, CO 80225; ‡Midwestern Regional Climate Center, Illinois State Water Survey, 2204 Griffith Drive, Champaign, IL 61820; and §U.S. Geological Survey, Desert Laboratory, 1675 West Anklam Road, Tucson, AZ 85745    \r\nEdited by Inez Y. Fung, University of California, Berkeley, CA, and approved January 12, 2004 \r\n\r\n \r\nMore than half (52%) of the spatial and temporal variance in multidecadal drought frequency over the conterminous United States is attributable to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). An additional 22% of the variance in drought frequency is related to a complex spatial pattern of positive and negative trends in drought occurrence possibly related to increasing Northern Hemisphere temperatures or some other unidirectional climate trend. Recent droughts with broad impacts over the conterminous U.S. (1996, 1999–2002) were associated with North Atlantic warming (positive AMO) and northeastern and tropical Pacific cooling (negative PDO). Much of the long-term predictability of drought frequency may reside in the multidecadal behavior of the North Atlantic Ocean. Should the current positive AMO (warm North Atlantic) conditions persist into the upcoming decade, we suggest two possible drought scenarios that resemble the continental-scale patterns of the 1930s (positive PDO) and 1950s (negative PDO) drought.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nwww.stopglobalcoolin  ​ gnow dotcom January 10, 2010 \r\n\r\n \r\nAn excellent analysis article details the natural cycles of both the Atlantic and Pacific Multi-Decadal Oscillations.  The article points to research being done that shows when the ocean currents are in warm phase, the Earth experiences warming.  When they are in cold phase, well, you get the idea. While the rise in CO2 levels may play a part in rising temperatures, it’s a very small part.  Mostly the climate is driven by natural forces. They say the ocean currents could be as much as 50% responsible. \r\nAccording to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado, Arctic summer sea ice has increased by 409,000 square miles, or 26 per cent, since 2007 – and even the most committed global warming activists do not dispute this. \r\nFor example, in 1974, a Time magazine cover story predicted ‘Another Ice Age’, saying: ‘Man may be somewhat responsible – as a result of farming and fuel burning [which is] blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the Earth.’ \r\nCap & Trade and global climate treaties to stop global warming are the wrong approach.  They will cripple already ailing economies and do nothing but redistribute wealth and give power to bureaucrats at the U.N.  It’s hard to know someone’s motives, but it does fit that perhaps that is the real aim.  Not to “save the planet,” (such a lofty sounding goal) but rather to manufacture an issue and use it as a power grab.  Thankfully all of this cold weather is giving a lot of people pause and may help thwart those evil plans.  That is why I am all for global cooling!

The federal government ordered car companies to adjust their mpg ratings a few years ago, car companies were using the top level anyone could get and the government wanted it more in the average. So a lot of mpg's went down even then no one in the north will get the mileage a person in warmer climates will and no one in high latitudes will either. And anyone that believes that these two car companies did this by mistake well I have land on mars I want to sell you.

I agree Mudkips..."people", and I use that term loosely, would rather end up in a head on collision rather than hit a dog thats in their lane...a normal person would not give human rights to animals or hold them in a higher regard than people...someone commented earlier that they would literally kill everyone in that shelter who would "murder" his dog...that is the sickest of the sick, kinda like the person would kill a 10 year old girl and dismember her body...there is a difference between respecting animals and treating them like gods...

That is correct, NEVER admit to anything. This from countless attorneys and police officers. It's like the old trick \r\n"Exuse me did you know the speed limit is 65"? \r\n"I'm sorry I was only going 68" \r\nRight there you've already admited to guilt.  \r\nAnd practically every person I know who's received a speeding ticket, the officer has reduced the reported speed.

I applaud those of you who use your intelligence for civil discourse regarding this issue, regardless of your political affiliation.  For those of you who are incapable of civil discourse, you are willing and eager participants in the downfall of humanity, which is as important as the economy, for without it, how do we survive without one another when disasters such as Hurricane Sandy strike?  We should not be living in a dog eat dog world.  We should honor one another as fellow humans, living together on a rock in the universe, not as one person or race superior to another.  From some of these posts, I get the feeling that some of you live with the notion that you are entitled to that feeling of supremacy, and that is **** and you are wrong to think that you are.

Bloomberg Endorses Obama, Citing Climate Change \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMr. Bloomberg, a political independent in his third term leading New York City, has been sharply critical of both Mr. Obama, a Democrat, and Mitt Romney, the president’s Republican rival, saying that both men have failed to candidly confront the problems afflicting the nation. But he said he had decided over the past several days that Mr. Obama was the best candidate to tackle the global climate change that the mayor believes contributed to the violent storm, which took the lives of at least 38 New Yorkers and caused billions of dollars in damage.

Actually Stacy, you sound like the bitter one. In my experience, I've seen highly educated, professional women marry 'less educated' men for some well thought out and specific reasons - or 'standards', if you will. In those cases the women were busy professionals and wanted a guy that had the interest and ability to take more responsibility for the home fires. We're not talking stay at home dads either, these are also educated professional guys with careers but with a willingness to support, even defer to, her career. These are not 'low' standards - ask any woman trying to find the guy that fits this bill. \r\n\r\nFinal note - if we follow your logic through that women are lowering their standards today, we would have to conclude then that, historically, with women 'marrying up', men were lowering their standards.  Is that what you believe?

I've only not tipped ONCE in my entre life.  We never got our food, an apology or anything.  The manager had to bring our meals, who didn't apologize either.  We didn't leave because we were on vacation in Florida with a hungry three year old.  Almost every server I encounter are courteous, hardworking and polite.  Food servers deserve the tips.  They make under minimum wage and tips make up for that.  That said, I refuse to tip in places like Starbucks, where their job is get me a cup of coffee, while making a decent salary.

my mother owned a toyota echo, it was amazing on gas, many owners said they got 45miles/gallon.. but it was discontinued..  the toyota yaris was supposed to replace it and i bought a yaris sedan.. the gas mileage was pretty good.. now i want to buy another yaris sedan but they dont seem to make the sedan model anymore :((( most yaris owners are happy with the gas mileage & get better than the rating.. It matters how you drive the car as well, some can get better mileage by driving with gas mileage in mind..

The biggest problem is the use of ethanol blended gasoline. It takes 1 and 1/2 gallons of ethanol to equal the BTU output of one gallon of regular non blended gasoline. Add to that the ethanol is a 'dry' fuel that accelerates the wear in engine components and you reduce both the life and efficiency of the engine. Now add to that the cost to produce ethanol fuel in regards to the higher use of diesel to produce and deliver the ethanol and you have even more waste. Then as a final condemnation of the use of ethanol it reduces the average mile per gallon efficiency by over one mpg for the average car or truck. Is it any wonder the federal government does not care about the inefficiency since they tax consumption on the gallon of gas you purchase at the pump? The inefficiency raises more money for the government...so they are in the business of preventing higher efficiency to a large extent to make more money to waste on pet projects.  \r\n  \r\nNext

I thought that a retirement fund, would worry more about, how their earnings were appreciating for their retirees, versus other issues that do nothing to bring down the value of shares of the above mentioned company. If they are so worried about labor laws, why don't they just sell the company shares, and buy others instead. I also agree with Just my opinion76, in why not name all company's, not just one. unless, they are looking to win some type of settlement, on their retirees behalves. It so, it goes to show just how greedy people are, about the almighty dollar, and the way they go about getting it.  I wonder if any of their retirees have looked into their boards decisions, on their buying practices lately, what they own, and if any bad decisions were made. If so, that they might be inclined to file suit against the board, to recover any, and all bad investments their board made.

I love Ugg Boots, It's just the price. You can buy the same style just in a off-brand at a way better price. Personally I find Ugg's to be too expensive and in today's economy its just best to find the most reasonable price. I don't quite believe they're going out a style. It's just that the company Ugg is to expensive to even think about

Can we blame the guy for such a non analogist analogy? Come on; think about it, he is not like most of us. Romney has lived a pampered life. He never has, and probably never will, feel the devastation that the victims of Sandy are feeling. He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, went to privet school and got a free ride in collage. When a lot of his peers went, and died in the hell of Vietnam, he was able to get deferments so he could travel Europe and push his religion on others. Poor Romney had to rely on his dad’s inheritance and sell some of the stocks until he was able to provide for himself. The life of Mitt Romney is a life that a vast majority of us will never have or could possibly relate to. Give him a brake, in the life of Mitt Romney, the only analogy that could come to mind, was a messy football field. \r\n  \r\nIs this a surprise to anyone?

"The Fidelity model assumes you need to replace 85% of your final pay..."\r\n\r\nUntil the past decade, this assumed you need 2/3 or 67% of your final pay which I think fits most people who were paying a mortgage until close to retirement and have a mortgage-free home in retirement.\r\n\r\nIn retirement I don't have the mortgage, I'm not saving for retirement, I'm not paying FICA, a significant amount of my retirement income is shielded from taxes, I don't have work related costs, I have more time to comparison shop and cook my own meals, etc.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people have significantly higher health costs because they lose their employer's insurance but fortunately Medicare Advantage or Medicare B & D with supplemental insurance keeps costs from being catastrophic.  Fortunately for me, my insurance premiums are effectively 75% subsidized by the current workers, not the company, and that's a better guarantee they won't be cut at some point: the current workers know they'll need retirement insurance themselves.

Team Romney Admits “Relief” Event Was Staged for Political Reasons \r\nI also found this part of the story fascinating. The Romney campaign admits that the intent behind the rally was swing state election visibility, not hurricane relief: \r\n \r\nBut Boston wasn’t quite ready to lose a full day of swing state visibility with a week left in the race. So, after some deliberation, the campaign decided to use their existing venue in Ohio to stage a makeshift, and nonpartisan, humanitarian project. It would be a way for Romney to show leadership — and get on the local news — without looking craven or opportunistic. \r\nThey weren’t willing to lose a day’s visibility in a swing state, so they came up with the event and crafted it in a way that would still get them political benefit, but would camouflage the intent.  So, as I predicted, Team Romney saw Hurricane Sandy – saw the imminent peril of tens of millions of Americans – as a political "oppotunity" to exploit.

As one of Irish decent and having been over to Ireland on 5 different occasions I can honestly say drinking and exchanging philosophical conversation blends well together with the Irish. More so due to when "the pour" of The Guinness is good. If you've been over and drank The Guinness when the CO2 is set just right along with the bartender has just brushed and cleaned the tap lines the Guinnes that flows then is some kind of drug. It really takes over your senses and if maintained at a good steady pace one can get in this euphoric state of high intelligence with the locals..

Thank god! These are the ugliest boots to ever be created. I’ll never understand why they became so popular. They make the base of your foot look like giant boats and add a ton of visual weight to your calves. Maybe to save their company Ugg should consider re-designing and re-vamping their line to include more stylish varieties. They are supposedly top quality and very warm – these boots just need a style overhaul!

They always ask you if you know how fast you were going, and my experience is that it's been inconsistent whether they want you to say yes or no; I've gotten out of tickets claiming ignorance sometimes, and sometimes have gotten out by admitting that I was going as fast as they clocked me. I completely agree with the idea that you don't give lip to the man! It's amazing to me how people don't know that - even as a rich white boy, I do that; if you're driving a piece of crap car or if you're a minority, you should be even more deferential! And yeah, it's not "fair" - who cares? He's got the power to make your life hell - give him the respect he wants!

"You know that Bernanke is there until 2014, right?  And it's not like there's much in the way of fiscal stimulus happening right now.  That's the reason Bernanke is being so hamfisted about it.  It's broad policies that are trying to activate remote segments of the market.  The Fed can't create demand, only enable demand that's priced out of the market.  Fiscal policy can create demand."\r\n\r\nYep.  But the Fed's policies can discourage and punish SAVING.  And promote MORE BORROWING.  Which is what got us here in the first place.\r\n\r\nHopefully Romney can boot Ben early.

How many times is this same situation in the news?! We're not talking about someone's lost dog who is not claimed in time, we're talking about shelters aware of the situations! There is gross oversight in too many shelters, and they are in serious need of reform. Offering a new pet free of charge is simply distasteful and rude. They are pets, family to many, and can and should not be treated and replaced like inanimate objects.

He took offense to wearing a uniform in a wheelchair?  Huh???   \r\n I guess maybe he took offense to the idea of someone dressing up as a paralyzed soldier for Halloween.  That part's understandable, but obviously there's no excuse for immediately reacting with violence, and for not stopping to consider the possibility that maybe he really was a paralyzed soldier.

What the h€ll are you talking about? What, are you bipolar? Have anger issues?or are you just dumb? 1. Ya, this is just a comment thread......so I made a comment. 2. Do you call everyone a d bag who comments on your posts? No? Oh, I see,it must be because I called you out on your ridiculous comment, and you were offended. So I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. 3. Next time, try and stay on task, and post your comment on the thread I posted on, instead of posting a  rebuttal on some other random thread.  Oh, and P.S. being called a d bag loses its sting when you call everyone and their dog one. So if you reply, why not grow a wrinkle and come up with something fresh and new. Maybe double your vocabulary and learn a new word.

Ethically and morally this is wrong. I must say , the writing on the wall does not match, it is too hasty to judge if this is a propaganda to blast a single mom for not tipping. Waitresses and waiters rely on the tips for their pay so if you are going out and you get the best service, it is but right to give them the 20 percent... if you are hard up , then do not go out, unless somebody invited you for free and they are footing the bill. Moral conscience should guide one, but not all have that nowadays even the one who put this out as a show or is this really true? Well you caught my eye, you did your purpose , am I right? Get on living righeously, please?

Go get a book about handwriting analysis.  Actually it is a very fascinating subject.  The handwriting does not look at all like a woman’s handwriting, but looks so much like a man’s hand writing.  Also the handwriting is very inconsistent; at least two different people’s handwriting.  Also the sign of a liar and/ or inconsistency is printing and cursive in the same sentence.

The Bible has NO PLACE in politics. Sure it should count as electioneering. The problem with religion and Gods, is their are a whole bunch of both and there followers are all sure there God is the right one. Don't try to legislate your morals on everyone, keep your religions in your church, synagogue, or mosk. Where they belong.

The biggest assumption you'll probably make is that your income / earnings / investments will be enough to carry you through retirement to death.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that retirees find that they didn't anticipate gas would double ($2-$4), or taxes continue to go up because of voted bond debts, or healthcare costs rise so quickly as you age and require more medications / health aids / assistance.\r\nThe retirement of the baby boomers is unprecedented with 1/4 of the total US population being over the age of 65 within the next 15 years. This will cause a large demand for those goods and services that are required to manage the problems of the aged. Inflationary factors will be amplified as demand will exceed supplies / services available. The costs for providing these necessities of the aged could possibly rise exponentially, exceeding normally prudent planning and saving for a historically "normal" retirement.\r\nThe same factors that caused the nickel candy bar to become the dollar candy bar will be felt in all sectors and services. The government will be overwhelmed by the seer volume and won't be able to pay for all this extra expense of supporting so many seniors.\r\n\r\nTo financially plan for this will be daunting at best.  The best recourse is to be over prepared financially than under, or face possible poverty in your twilight years.

SUE THE COP? You apparently seem to want to justify this officers action. This moron never should have been in law enforcement or the Public Safety Dept. I cannot under any circumstance see justification for what was done to this child. If this officer had pulled his service weapon and done the same action, we would be commenting on a deliberate homicide. Top to bottom evaluations are going to happen and the New Mexico public is going to pay for retraining, lawsuit settlements and diminished general-fund services.

Bush/Cheney really screwed up the economy... The effects are still being felt 4 years later... President Obama have steered the economic ship of state away from the rocky shores where Bush/Cheney ran aground, and steered it back on course in deep blue water and he has five sheets to the wind... The economy is growing across all sectors... All economic news is positive news... The big house middle classers who vote Republican just can't accept the fact that President Obama has fixed the economy despite Mitch McConnell and all the Republicans obstructing, blocking, filibustering and doing everything they can to destroy American and destroy the lives of as many middle class Americans as possible...  On Novenber 7, We the People will move forward and re-elect President Obama and put an end to the Republican's anti-American folly...

In Michigan i use to talk my way out of speeding tickets ALL the time.  The cops were usually gearheads and if you could be friendly and get them talking about hot rods or old muscle cars they'd give you a warning at the end of it all.  In the state of Washington, forget it...the cops there are all relatives of Robocop and will give you a ticket (my personal experience) no matter what you do, lol.

Labor laws can just as easily be undone.\r\nWitness how easy it was to institute NAFTA, et al.\r\nWitness how effortless it was for the Rs to push through Gramm Blilley etc.\r\nWitness how smooth operators can just yell "Muslim" and "not born here" and how many are inducted with false beliefs, without bothering to investigate them.\r\nWitness how many are turned by simple slogans and engineered phrasing.\r\nWitness how much is gained financially to the top tiers using "shock doctrines". \r\n\r\nYes, labor laws are the codified results of the society's willingness to set things right and assist labor to share in the fruits of their labors.  But they can just as easily be abrogated should our collective incentives be poisoned, such as is happening now with the campaign to denigrate public and private unions, not to mention  public employees and especially, teachers.  \r\n\r\nVigilance is still key to maintaining labor rights and protections.

Fascinating...where did you get your facts?\r\n \r\nI'm a Trooper and just feel the need to counter some of your claims...call me crazy.\r\n \r\n1. Never have I (or any officer I know) received training on making a contact last at least/greater than 20 minutes.  In fact, in my academy, we were trained to not take more than 20 minutes on a contact receiving a ticket.  If we took longer, we got punished for it (i.e. grade points reduced, pushups, etc.).  I now have my contacts down to 8-10 minutes for warnings.\r\n \r\n2. I cannot speak for other officers, but I know of no other Trooper in my agency that began writing more citations due to the economy.  We have no quota.  We could go entire months without writing a ticket (if that were possible) and not hear a thing about it.  Perhaps it is possible in some smaller local agencies.  My concern is traffic safety.  When crashes are the #1 cause of death for 18-35 year olds, I don't care who you are, you're getting a ticket, if you're going fast enough, and have no good reason for it (my ticket cutoff being 12 mph on highways and 15 mph on certain, paved county roads, for me).  Bringing me to my last point...\r\n \r\n3.  I have never known any officer to not give a ticket to an "attractive" person. I have written many "attractive" women, tickets, and have never reduced to a warning because of beauty. We are doing our job, not meeting singles.  That would not be faithful to our oath.  I'm not so blind to say it has never happened, but not on the grand sweeping scale you portray in your comment. That's Hollywood's interpretation of what we do.\r\n \r\nBTW, if what you say in your last sentence is true, and not born out of the movies...did it occur to you that these women, who say they repeatedly got breaks on traffic stops, may be lying to you in an effort to keep their fagile self-image afloat?

I realize this show had been planned for quite awhile but couldn't help think about those suffering in the New England states as the CMA was being aired; the deaths, loosing their homes. . .   I didn't watch a lot of the show but I so hope that their plight was at least mentioned, even if it was just asking those at the awards and those watching from home to please help in anyway they can.  \r\n  \r\nI did watch The Voice this past week and after watching just a "little" bit of the awards, I can't believe Blake Sheldon wouldn't choose a contestant to go forward because of her song choice (an old rock song).  Prior to this song she  was the best  County singer that has been on The Voice.

Something to think about ....these are human beings ...CHILDREN who are alive and deserve the same rights of existing as all of us. Think now.....THINK.....Is  ​  this an example of Mitt Romney's investments or the so called way he turns a compan'sy loss to profits.  You have to be consistent in your thoughts this is an act of infamy against children. You have to see what Romney has done in the past not what he says with his fast talking lies of how he cares about getting jobs....yeah  to abused children or outsourcing penny labor. To me he is a scary Damian.

If you have enough money for $140 meal, then you can afford a tip. Waitresses make very little hourly wage and depend on that money to survive.  No single mother I know, would spend $140 on one meal, unless they were a rich single mother. If that was the case, then the non-tipping just makes you a selfish biotch. Either way, she was out of line.

None of these articles ever make any sense. There are so many variables and assumptions in them and you are trying to use it over a 30-50 year period it is just silly. I agree you need to think about saving for retirement as early as possible but besides that there is really not much you can do. the 10% rule is a good start. 1/2 of all bonuses and raises added on to that is another. If you do this you should come close. After that you will just have to adjust your life style to you income when the time comes.

I have never been in a union, but I was working on a heavy construction project when there was an election to determine if the project would be unionized.Before the election our wages and benefits were all upgraded. We got union scale wages and benefits witjhout having to pay union dues!The mere possibility of unionization improved our employment. \r\nI have not been a big fan unions. Some of them are controlled by organized crime. I heard some time ago that the teamsters were organizing police unions! \r\nThat said, if you think that today's employers have somehow become morally superior to their predecssors in the 19th and 20th centories, you are sadly mistaken. Business (particularly big business) will always try to pay the workforce as little as possible. Unions, despite their may flaws, raise wages and benefits for employees.

I didn't watch, because it's not country - and the funny thing is a lot of these songs refer to the authentic country singers, like Hank or Waylon or even the first new wave like George Strait, but in 3 years I have never once heard my local country stations play even 1 song a day other than the artists on the CMA. like you all said, it's pop, not country.  I miss Mel Tellis, hell I miss Pam Tillis.

Koo you are a fool, and don't know that it takes as much energy to be as you call it a right wing\r\nChristian fanatic as it dose to be a left wing liberal socialist. The deference is the Christian fanatic\r\nwhats you to live your life in a country that is in the guide lines of are forefathers. A country that\r\nis free a country that has true liberty a country that gives you the right to say as you think and \r\ngives me the right to disagree. A country that will not allow the bill of rights to be taken from us.\r\nA country that whats a leader to lead in honesty and truth and not over burden the people with\r\nto much goverment, taxs and laws interfering with thier ability to become proud that they have\r\na job or a business that they can be proud to be able to enter into the American dream. I have\r\nbeen disable for 13 years, But my wife has been blessed and has had good employment for 33\r\nyears. I was a 4th generation Industrial steel painter in 1999 July 2nd I fell 42 feet while painting\r\na bridge. I have never collected unemployment, diabality but I did collect workmans compinsation\r\nfor 2 years. I said this to you because I only want what is mine I am 60 years old and when I can I will collect my social security. I was blessed to have good children that helps when we need it to\r\nprovide my medication. What we need is a President that will do the right thing and not be a\r\nlyer & a coward that won't take care of muslims that murdered our Heros who was there to help\r\nand bring good to Libia. He won't do it he him self is a black muslim. Rather you what to believe it\r\nor not I live in Chicago Land and we know the truth about obama and his wife. They have declared\r\nwar on us and anyone else that isn't muslim. And obama is a black muslim so he's not going to do\r\nnothing. He is going to try his best get away with do nothing until after the election but every action\r\nhas a reaction and he will get his upcomins.

Did you bother to read further....IT"S FALSE..  \r\nLet me get this right...Corporate Billionaires can have BUY political clout and pay lobbiest to tie up governmental hearings in whatever circle they choose, but when it comes to employees who help make or provide those Corporate Billionaire's companies services or products getting together and unionizing oh no shame on them, they should be happy that they have a job at all, our society pretty much runs that way...those who got it pretty much control those who don't. Problem seems to be that those at the top will not take less money because to keep their investors happy they have to produce $$$$$$$ returns... so they will just take away benefits, reduce work force, or shift to a cheaper labor market. Our capitalistic ways dictate that what goes around comes around. If my boss pays me $10 an hour, then you can pretty well bet that it will cost me close or more than that just to sustain myself, these so called job providers will make sure of that. They do not want anyone to "get ahead" someone has to be held at the bottom to do the dirty work...unionized workers don't mind working and doing the dirty work...but you billionaires will sure enough pay enough to make it worth the effort. If labor were costing them so much then why are their so many new millionaires and billionaires even in these hard times, not hard to draw a narrow minded opinion.

I don't blame Giuliana at all.  I know another couple who couldn't get pregnant, but finally achieved it by in vitro.  The couple's brother, had the opposite problem, and he and his wife couldn't afford all those kids they made.  Finally, his mom stepped in and paid for his vasectomy.  When I was a teenager, there was very little teen pregnancy because people practiced self-control except for girls trying to trap a guy.  In this day and age of birth control and abortion, there seems to be no reason for teenage pregnancy.  Maybe it's still to trap a guy or to just collect a welfare check.

Panic time at Christmas because of the strong dollar. \r\nInflation defeated, oddly enough is a good thing for the economy, maybe not Wall Street. \r\nIf Obama wins rich will be taxed, middle class will shrink dramaticly, nobody will have any money which will strengthen the dollar even further, and kiss the stock market goodbye.

@AfricanGirly- I think since your from Ghana what may seem "normal" and "ok" to you, is not ok here! We fought for our freedom, we fought for our labor laws, we fought for education. By saying it's ok makes America slip backwards and LOSE all that we Have fought for. Which is a slap in the face to all of those who stood up for injustices not just for themselves but for all generations to come. we are not talking about small little farming families. Do you know how many small farms it would take to keep up with their demand?  @winter-you are the problem with America. You worry about the price of something going up so you condone child slave labor, so you don't have to pay more!!  The cost shouldn't be passed on to the consumer in this case but paid by the greedy with the blood soaked money that lines their pockets!

To Notsosure10. I have worked in the Ethanol business for quite some time. Ethanol produces more BTU per gallon then gasoline. The reason you get less fuel milage is because all cars are a low compression engine. A higher compression ratio will make ethanol burn mor effieciently and better milage will be achieved. Gasoline when combusted has a 80% heat to 20% propultion ratio. Ethanol is 70% heat to 30% propultion ratio. The statement of it being a "dry" fuel and will accelerate the "wear" on your engin is far from the truth. The issue of running ethanol in a gasoline engine is the rubber components. Fuel lines, rubber gaskets, etc are not designed to handle the ph and corrosive properties of ethanol. Due to this these components tend to leak and degrade over time. Automobile manufacturers have stepped up to the plate on many of these issues and have changed the properties of such components. By the way the "corrsive" properties of ethanol I stated is just the issue of being a very good solvent. Ethanol is such a good solvent it can breakdown many rubber or hydrocarbon based rubbers over time, unless new rubber components made to prevent this are used. Ehanol actually cleans out dirty filters and can cause issues in vehicles if these filters are not changed on a regular frequency. \r\n  \r\nAs for your statement on it being a inefficiently fuel when it comes to producing it are for the most part true. Ethanol production is 3.0 BTUs in to 3.2 BTUs out.. Thats not that great! The hope is that celluosic production will break this ineffciency. I have not seen anything that says that the celluosic process is in operation or even feasible. It seems there has been no talk on this subject lately. \r\nIf you question ethanol subsidies for production of it. The big oil companies get that. Not the farmer who produced the corn, and not the ethanol plant that made the ethanol. Big oil got that money to produce ethanol infastructure to support ethanol blending in fues and to transprt ethanol to refineries. As far as what i can tell is that big oil just lined their pockets with that money because as for infastructure for ethanol use in the contry is hardly existant.

Unions are the dinosaur of the American employment landscape. They are no doubt the most influential reason why the United States cannot compete globally for manufacturing jobs. Does anyone remember the bridge in San Fran that utilized steel from the far east because having the steel made in the U.S. was way too expensive due to expensive labor costs ??? I always thought that in the U. S. the needs of the many must outweigh the needs of the few (yea, I know that Spock said it, so save the grilling) But to save several thousand ridiculous paying jobs, the unions are forgoing hundreds of thousands of other potential jobs at a very reasonable wage. Get rid of unions and watch how attractive the United States becomes once again, even though we may still be a bit more expensive. On another note.......the taxpayers bail out Chrysler, Chrysler sells to the Italians, the Italians outsource the jobs to China, meanwhile I live in Italy and the unemployment rate here seriously sits at about thirty percent. The world is truly one f........d up place............Tha  ​ t is all, carry on..................  ​

Lately it seems like for the past several years every time Honda or Toyota show a concept of something awesome, by the time it gets to market it's a total turd.  The CR-Z is a perfect example.\r\n \r\nWhen I first saw it I thought "Finally a Honda I would actually drive, that thing is awesome looking!!!" And then out came the production specs and Honda had ruined it.  It's not fast like it should have been and it doesn't produce worth while fuel economy numbers to make it viable.  It's an amazing looking car with an identity crisis.  And the sales numbers reflect that.

What....

I was driving about 10 mph over and saw the officer flip around. I immediately took an off ramp and topped my car out at 110 mph. About a minute later, I saw the cherries in the horizon. I slowed and pulled over as quickly as I could. The officer (State Patrol) asked why I was going so fast. I told him I saw him turn around and I thought I could get away. He said said thanks for being honest and gave me a ticket for 10 over.

I agree that Pabst Blue Ribbon is really not bad beer, and much cheaper than the slop Budweiser calls beer.  Brewing beer with rice like Bud does really makes it taste nasty.  However, I was a little disillusioned with PBR when I found out that the brewing of PBR is subcontracted to a Molson-Coors brewery in New York.  Pabst no longer brews their own beer.  Coors is almost as nasty as Bud.

NotSoSure10, \r\nMy congratulations for this posting.  This is the most intelligent, up front and truthful posting that I have read on here in years.  And just think the Government is the ones behind ethanol fuel.  Time to stand up and get them to do what is right and get rid of all the shady tricks.

Mudkips4Lyf, are you the negative little twit that has been posting the thumbs down to these messages?  Do you also have mommy and daddy issues?  If the answers to both of those questions  are yes, then there are some people who are wearing white laboratory coats and have some words and other things to help you out with your chronic case of jackazzitis.  Thank you and have a good day.

Don't buy one.  This Obamacare is another plan to move money from middle-class Americans to big business, specifically the big insurance companies.  Requiring health insurance will cause the price to skyrocket.  Already doing it.

Go take some driving courses to learn how to drive. In theory it IS possible to make ANY car exceed the EPA ratings or not. Its how you drive your vehicle. There is such thing as free power,, The harder you accelerate, more fuel you'll burn.  The less you accelerate and break, less energy is used; something the hypermilers do to sometimes double their MPG, but could also be unsafe.

more on cma performances:  i thought t. swift's 'Begin Again' was simple and well-poised.  good song too.  on the other hand, little big town gave a terribly cheesy performance of their otherwise glorious 'Pontoon'.  could learn a few things about fun from swift's 'Mean' performance from a year or two ago. \r\n brad paisley just finished a great performance of his great new 'Southern Comfort Zone'.  Particularly liked how he lifted the chorus from 'Empire State of Mind' to kick it off. \r\n also brad did a real good gangnam style.

you didn't even have to read the article itself, the TITLE says "But it's inaccurate."....so you go ahead and vote for Romney and see how jacked up this country gets with him in office...btw...what exactly is his plan on turning our economy around? Because even the top economists don't even know exactly how to. Romney even said "It will take 8 to 12 years to fix the damage done by the Bush administration."....  ​ so why does the hippocrate think Obama failed because he couldn't get it done in 4? .... even basic statistics..you can't fix 8 years of damage in just four...we will be fixing this economy for the next 2-3 terms. Romney has his OWN interests and agenda to fulfill before he fills your needs!!!

My wife is an inspiration to me.  After receiving her B.A. in Communications; she grew tired of working dead end jobs in sales.  She was a natural when it came to medically related things and I encouraged her to think about becoming a doctor or a nurse.  Even though she graduated in 1996, she went back to school and became an R.N. in 2011.  She loves her achievement and her confidence level has gone through the roof.  She recently re-enrolled to further her nursing education.  She's awesome.

You can almost say this is a LA, NYC special tax.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThe real danger is that in 20 years this will effect just about all transactions.  As the massive inflation caused by Obamanomics will make this a new middle class tax.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis democrat war on the middle class is long term.   They will seize your 3.8% and they are willing to wait 20 years to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ACA needs to be repealed.   The middle class does not want to pay for healthcare for the 47% on top of all the welfare they already collect from those that EARN a living...

From what I've experienced, city, county and state police are professional and required to meet certain standards. I was raised by a "stater" so I know first hand, they are very strict in regard to fitness, staying current on laws and range practice. It's almost like the military.

I guess every officer is different.  I have a friend that was a cop and asked him what to say when I get pulled over, he said to never openly admit that you were speeding because then you are admitting to breaking the law.  He said it was easier to give tickets to people who admitted to breaking the law and easier in court because he would use their admittance against them.  Just depends on each situation I guess.

So were these people there to work for free or were they getting paid?  What's the problem with honoring a union shop if that is where you are getting your pay?  Did they offer to work for the non-union rate or were they going to collect the same pay as everybody else they were working with?  If you read this article it clearly says that they were re-assigned while waiting for clarification of the documents that they were being asked to sign.

This is to show you if you use blind guides what could happen. Matt 15 read it. He was putting his faith into a stone which can do not one thing for him. Isa 42 read it. He had a hart that was not callest he was just oing what man had told him. He did not go looking like a needle in a hay stack, he settled for less than THE FATHERS best. \r\n \r\nIf we are like a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that is not there, what kind of guides are we using? If a blind man leadsa a blind man they will both fall into a pit. I am not perfect my JESUS shoes are broken. It goes to show that we have all fallen short of GOD and HIS wonderful grace. We all need to REPENT and sin no more.

Ok Mr. Officer, if you want to give us a ticket, then don't speed yourself.  Come to a complete stop at a stop sign, and oh yeah, don't make that illegal U-turn.  I have seen so many officers in their police cars and motorcycles doing this.  And why?  Because they can get away with it.  So it you can get away with it, then don't pull me over if I do it.

Many parents here will only allow their kids to attend Halloween Parties sponsored by community organizations.  Often this involves businesses, schools and church organizations.  Sadly - some local preachers choose to ask the county commission to change Halloween from wednesday - so that it would not interfere with their Wednesday Church services.  These selfish individuals could have scheduled Halloween Gatherings that included Parents and KIDs to keep them off the streets and out of danger from poisoned candy. \r\n  \r\nSadly - the county commission fell down to their knees to lick the boots of these selfish preachers.  It has been common in this area to change Halloween when it falls on Sunday - but now it appears that these religious idiots think that they need to claim another day as theirs.

The general consensus seems to be that it's ok so long as Taylor Swift didn't win.  lol.  But yes, I agree, it really should have gone to Jason Aldean.  Only reason it went to Blake was because he's doing The Voice now so more people know who he is.  It has nothing to do with being an entertainer anymore, nowadays the only people who win Entertainer of the Year are those who are best known OUTSIDE country music.  Which basically means the CMA doesn't care about it's own people, or country music, all they care about is impressing the rest of the entertainment business.

This statistic is nothing new.  This has been a trend for a number of years now.  One more, of many, reasons why I think that this coddling of young female girls should cease and more emphasis placed on the educational needs of young boys.  Feminists have achieved their goals and then some.  Now it's time to focus on males for a change.

All the people that put the unions down are out of the loop. I wont argue with an idiot,as that would make me one too.I do know that if it was`nt for unions a lot of the non union people in the cities would not be getting the good wages they are making.I have been a union tradesman my whole career,and I will tell you if You don`t keep up with the technology of your trade ,Your not going to be around very long.I worked for 37 years in my craft and attended schooling for about 25 yrs at night,to stay on top of my work. Don`t even think that the jobs were outsourced because of unions. that just shows your  ignorance.Many union companys moved even when they were showing a great profit. the real reason that most companies moved was pure greed. Most people who knock the unions do not know a thing about them. If union employees are always sitting around watching one person doing all the work, how did all the skyscapers , bridges , tunnels etc get built. So just don`t say union people are all lazy because You saw some of them standing around, sometimes that happens when You get to a certain phase of a job

The last time I was pulled over I was returning to my youngest brother's home in Vermont from Freihofer's Jazz Festival in Saratoga Springs, New york. It was about 9:20 PM, and I was following several cars at about 45 MPH, which seemed like a reasonable speed. I see the lights come on behind me, and I immediately pull over to the side of the road. The officer asks me if I know why he pulled me over, to which I reply no. I take out my license, registration, PBA cards, union card, town ID, and AAA card I think. He comments that I sure have a lot of stuff, and I agree. He explained that the reason I was pulled over was because I was driving 44 MPH in a 30 MPH zone. I explained to him that I was trying to get back to my brother's home in Verrmont, which was over an hour's drive away, assuming I didn't get lost, which I did LOL! I also stated I was trying to arrive there before 11:00 PM so as not to startle or worry my brother and his family. He told me to drive carefully and sent me on my way! That's not going to happen all the time, but  I'm sure glad it happened that time!

Went to see the movie today, in Imax. At first the story was tough to pick up, and some of the dialogue, but then I started to get it, between the different settings, and moments in time, b the end of the movie, I felt sublime. I found myself thinking of a girlfriend I had lost some years ago. The general public may stay away, but true movie lovers, and thse with the attention span to read a deep book, will thoroughly enjoy this epic.

Huh..??  There are a few remedies for a hangover... 1: Don't drink. 2: Don't progress UP in percentage of alcoholic volume in beverages as bedtime approaches. 3: Slam a Gatorade/Powerade or two before bed. You can drink water too, but it can cause a dilution of your electrolytes.  If you have access to a multivitamin or even just a banana, water is fine. 4: If 1, 2 and 3 have been done in the past without successful prevention of hangovers, pop an ibuprofen when you wake up.  5: If 1, 2, 3, and 4 don't resolve hangovers for you and ultimately you don't want hangovers, stick to the first solution. \r\n Source: I'm a drunken genius.

Actually she is quite proud of me you ****tard. But that really neither here nor there, the fact that you accuse me of something that isn’t true is awesome. Anyone that differs from your opinion must be satins spawn. \r\n \r\nMe on the other hand I could give a damn about you or your opinion. But hey, we're all entitled to our opinions, no matter how much of a tongue chewer you are. the liberal media takes **** out of context any time a conservative opens his or her mouth; and, oh by the way I watched his explanation of what he said and clips of what he said on CNN, one of the most liberal media outlets around. After watching the live unedited feed they then tried to continue to spin it. \r\n \r\nI know it’s a scary concept, but try thinking for yourself for once, you might actually find that you’re halfway intelligent.

Considering that there are only seven cars on this list that have any chance of blending in. And of those seven only the Caddy and the Speed3 are peppy enough without drawing too much attention to themselves to hide in the city. If you think you can get away on the freeway, you might as well turn yourself in before the chase starts. I have run, and gotten away a couple of times. And while I can admit to 99% of that being luck, that other 1% is knowing to stay in the city where there are lots of cars, tight spaces, high buildings, and parking garages to get lost in. Doesn't matter if you have a Mustang, Camaro, or a Lambo. If you can't blend, you're going to jail. Speed will NOT get you out of it. Your absolute best bet, is use a little speed to get out of the area, and then drive normally. And considering that even a Prius is capable of speeding and driving normally, it is just as good at hiding in the crowd. I'd say find yourself a bullet bike. The most common one sold in your area. And using short bursts of speed, and A LOT of regular riding, tight U-turns, and a lot of hiding, you may just have a chance of getting a way. But just a chance. Best bet would be get lost in a huge crowd of bikes before the eye in the sky catches up. Another thought, of the three times I've run, I got away all three times. It was also at night, on a weekend near the beach. Lots of motorcycle traffic to blend in with. Other than those three times, I have always taken the ticket because I know if I can get away or not. And the idea of going off-road is just moronic. A lone vehicle speeding through the desert, hell they don't even have to use a chopper, they can just follow your tracks. And as such, no point in buying the Raptor or other SUVs.. The Raptor is a great truck to drive though.

I guess people don't know real from fake, as UGG are and always were made in Australia, so if they say made in China you have been ripped off and paid for inferior shoes. \r\n Go to the UGG site and read the story on how UGGs came into being on the Coast of California, when an Australian started sealing his shoes there. \r\n  People believe only what they want and if something is to good, it might just not be the real thing, \r\n  So check out things before you buy, and see where they are made before you spend money on fakes.

That was a no-brainer and, yes, it should've been canceled.  Putting up a false front that all was well and that New Yorkers are resilient was foolish because sometimes you are simply laid low.  Anyone who's had a debilitating cold or fever knows this.  It's good to see that saner heads ultimately prevailed.

We are NOT talking about a West African Company doing this in West Africa where their culture is different from ours.  We are talking about an AMERICAN corporation doing this in another country.  And you are a fool if you think that they won't somehow (already started) start slowly doing it here!  They are about MONEY! at all cost and don't give a damn if it's American workers they prey on or West African workers. If America doesn't wake up and smell the coffee all the labor laws that past Americans fought hard for will be taken away, one by one.  It's been less than 100 years that WE had children working in factories, that WE worked for pennies 16 hours a day with no benefits.

The word Corporate Shareholder or Board Member has become a vision of viciously drooling greedy monsters feeding on humans young or old. The Devil has many soldiers spewing his demon seeds to humanity for him going by the name of "ME benefiting ME SEEDS". No wonder there is so much evil causing pain everywhere around the world the greedy powerful body snatchers have replaced bodies with empty SOULS. There muscle enforcers does not cleanse the evil bloody trail it originated from. Those Pitiful hollow shells void of humanity. I am sickened of how many shallow cold hearted DEMON BEINGS are abusing humanity. (They can't be called humans because humanity was created in God's image) Are there any out there that will let go of their worship of greed and reclaim their soul?

Of course they have something to sing about--how COUNTRY they are! I've always been a country music lover and have always played country music. Funny to me how, when I was 14 years old, country music was marketed mostly to adults. Now that I'm in my late 30s, it's marketed to 14-year-olds. I call today's music marketed as country, "Bad rock with banjo."

My first reaction to this story was that a cop sadistically took out his anger on a 10 year old when he "lost it". I've read two official reports provided by the links in the article and now it appears the boy was the victim of a thoughtless act by the cop that went horribly wrong. I don't believe the cop meant to taser the boy. My response would be to sue the State of NM for damages since this was a state cop who was directly responsible for what happened.

As a kid I lived in southern California and my Grandfather would would take me to the Busch gardens. They had exotic birds everywhere, free food and beer, and you could tour the brewery. It was fun and the people who worked there would brag about working for Budweiser because they paid well and it was seen as a good job. Consumers liked Bud. After inbev bought it forget about. FYI in that area of southern CA we also used to have a huge Levi jeans factory. People loved working there. Let's get simple manufacturing back to America, with decent wages, and focus on quality. Let's make here what our people need first, stop undercutting wages, and quality. Globalism is only good for the Corporations. It's time to get back to a little hardworking, God fearing, National Pride. Foriegn competion is a scam to oppress the people by pitting one labor force against another to drive down wage along with which quality suffers next.

Obama / Romney - flip sides of the same coin. It doesn't matter who you vote for, both parties are out to screw you. I'm not sure why people waste so much time arguing about it. If you think either of these jokers give a crap about you and is "out to do what is right for America", you are on some serious, well, whatever Obama was smoking before this picture!

two things that led to their downfall. \r\n 1. The boots are so cheaply made now, really flimsy and dent easily, I'll never buy them again. At one time probably before they got really popular like in 2007-08 they were plush and heavy and nice; kept you warm. They are so s.hitty now.\r\n \r\n 2. They bumped the price up at least $50. Maybe if the quality was still good, but now they just aren't worth it.

@Wannabe Nazi: In your own words: " So Hitler was a socialist and a champion of the workers -- or at least he identified himself as such and campaigned as such."\r\n \r\nThat is how he portrayed himself. He was a totalitarian nationalist. He was also a christian (so by your weak intellect all christians support mass genocide), but he didn't act like one. He was as far right as one could get. You truly have to be the most Fu*king retarded person I have ever met if you think he is left-wing. The world layed Germany low after WW I and to rally the people Hitler declared himself a man of the people. A socialist. He was neither. Pull your head out of you well used a$$ for once you ignorant twat.

$100k borders on tipping change for Brad.  Nevertheless, he's on the correct side of the equation.  It really is appalling that we are VOTING on this. \r\n 1. When two people mutually want to marry, the government should not even be in the dialogue. 2. Those opposed to same-sex marriage are opposing on religious grounds 3. Therefore, the government is effectively passing legislation on whether religion is to be recognized. \r\n Think carefully about #3 - That is exactly what's happening and it is WRONG.

Obama could careless about the people, and their ability to create jobs and wealth.. He only cares about his Anti-American liberal socialist-marxist ideology of big govt, in setting up his massive utopian state of govt control and manipulation..\r\n\r\nObama's view and belief of Freedom and Liberty, does not mean Individual American Freedom and Liberty, for all Americans, as prescribed under ,and by, the U.S. Constitution.. To Obama, Freedom and Liberty, means Govt. Freedom and Liberty, to do what it wants, when it wants, where it wants, to whomever it wants, as it wants, aka, govt. Tyranny and Oppression.. Which is why they, the Obama's, are completely, and without reservation -arrogant, indignant, and insouciant, to the people and their suffering, all around them..

In Genesis Chapter 3 vs 17 God told Adam CURSED IS THE GROUND FOR THY SAKE, in other words Adam because of what you did the earth is cursed. From that moment until now all the change of our environment has been because of that sin Adam committed and nothing is going to stop this earth from dying, that is why God will restore it as he says he will in Revelations Chapter 21, read it. We need to take care of our earth but we cannot change its demise.

Hahahahahaha!  If the statue had missed him, it would have been something along the lines of "the lord was protecting me", but since it didn't...maybe if his faith was a little stronger, he would see this as \r\n \r\nA) The "lord" putting him through a trial to test his faith (in which case he failed), or\r\n \r\nB) The "lord" smiting him for being a conniving, greedy materialist (since the "lord" is omniscient he, knew this guy would sue, and was right to slap him down).\r\n \r\nThe correct answer is that he was careless for not inspecting the statue prior to propping a ladder against it and clombing up.  He assumed it was secure enough to support his weight, and assumed nothing bad would happen.  He gambled and lost, rather than using the scientific method of research and fact finding.  Faith has never moved a mountain, but it has killed or maimed one hell of a lot of fools.

When the presidents administration ignored both the NSA and the CIA warnings about a terrorist organization having plans to attack the U.S., and 4,000 people died, were you calling for charges. By the GOP standard of accountability President Bush should have been brought up on charges. I don't remember conservatives making noise when we started a war on false pretenses. No they just made more excuses. Republicans are the party of excuses and no accountability. To have such a low I.Q and short memory must make everyday life tough.

N.A.T.  - Your question, while cute in an imbecilic way,  was not remotely analogous to the question posed.  Just because you don't think, but look for the simple, non-confrontational,  ​  it doesn't mean that others take your similar ostrich-head-in-the-  ​ sand approach.  In other words,  should humans of African ancestry on these shores buy into mutant/Caucasoid/whi  ​ te's hardwired, biologically-determi  ​ ned (due to being genetically recessive [See POTUS]  and having problems as does ALL MUTATIONS with reproducing [See Akin and Mourdock]) racism, sexism, and xenophobia (that Triumvirate of Terror), especially when they remain the PRIMARY victims?  Clearly, Chris and his friends didn't get the memo and the rage of most commenters suggest the profound disconnect.  Clearly, that's what time it is, much to the chagrin of mutants.

The Bible says nothing specifically about abortions.  It does say things about the poor, and the rich.  Pretty much the opposite of what some hard-line conservatives think it says.  Jesus said "Blessed are the poor".  NOT blessed are the rich.

The so-called country music of today is not country at all.  Country music is the likes of Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Hank Sr. etc.  To even think that the country music today would be country music is just plain blasphemy.

You don't NEED fraud protection if you don't have a credit card. That's a risk you take. No card, no risk. If you get the right debit card, (like mine), there is plenty of protection. If you are in the 3% of americans who pay off their cards each month, that's great. My comments are for the 97% (yes, 97%) who don't. What happens if you have a balance of $5,000 on your card, that you plan to pay off, and you lose your job, and your wife gets sick.... it happens all the time. No debt... NO RISK!!

There are many countries that produces cocoa that do not practice any kind of human slavery, Brazil is one of them. The reason that these big companies buy from places like china and Africa is because  they pay half of the price that they would pay buying from a country that does not endorses human slavery.

wow , don't you sound like a sexist white male straight out of the 1940's. Are you really going to stereotype all the women who are "career types" as having so much on their plate yet not being able to handle it emotionally? If these are the type of women you know I'm truly sorry, but your statement is extremely stereotypical and ignorant. Contrary to what it seems you believe, although women's neurophysiology results in being perhaps being more expressive or "emotional" than men, more often than not, this does not get in the way of functioning in a career or relationship. Do you suggest women not have a career and not take too much on her "plate" as to not be so emotional and have a bad relationship? I wish you would enlighten me.

It's sad that so many stars from that era have ended up as either druggies or alcoholics or both! Most of them starting out as children in the acting world. Yes, they had it going good for them but without proper guidance, and money management, many have had their lives ruined. It's very sad!! I agree that they must want to change to make it better for themselves, but again their whole life basically has been like this, it's a difficult change, especially without any support.\r\nI hope that before she completely runs out of everything, absolutely everything that she wakes up enough to want to get herself together with or without her husband!!

This is a load of hooey.  I've been pulled over for speeding 3 times in 3 different states.  The first time, I was headed over to meet up with some friends, and was accused of speeding when it was obviously the vehicle next to me.  I was issued a ticket, which I fought, and won.  The second time, I received a warning, but only because the officer got a call.  He was fully ready to write a ticket.  Had it open and ready when he walked up to my vehicle.  The third time, I had my cruise control set to the speed limit, and was accused of going 14mph over the speed limit around a dangerous curve, even though I was about 100 yards behind another vehicle who was going the speed limit as well.  All three times, I was respectful and curteous to the officer, I didn't admit to anything, since in none of those instances was I speeding at all, and I didn't give the officer anything to be suspicious about.  Officers will give tickets and warnings whenever they deem that they want to give a ticket for an offense, whether or not the person committed it at all.  I now live in Northern Nevada, where law enforcement is very scarce (the reasoning is reduced budgets, which I'm really not believing), and I've even seen highway patrol abuse their powers on the road.  One time, I was going the speed limit, passing a slower moving vehicle.  That vehicle sped up as I was passing, matching my speed.  Next thing I knew, there was another vehicle on my bumper.  The vehicle next to me kept speed, and the driver behind me was flashing his brights at me, as if that's going to cause me (a law abiding citizen) to speed up and break the law.  The next thing I knew, the light bar lit up and the flood light came on, focused at my vehicle.  It was at this time that the vehicle next to me slowed a little, and when there was enough distance, I pulled over and started heading to the shoulder and slowing down.  The law enforcement officer turned off the light bar and flood light, sped up, and passed me. As I accelerated back up to the posted speed limit, I saw this same procedure in effect on another vehicle. This is a TOTAL abuse of position, and any officer doing this just to pass vehicles should be fired and banned from any job requiring the operation of a motor vehicle. I did file a report/complaint of the incident with the highway patrol office, but they told me that I wouldn't be able to know the outcome since it was an internal incident.  I feel that ANY office funded by taxpayer funds should be obligated to make public any and all complaints and the outcome of those complaints since it is the public who funds them.

I live in VA and the reckless driving threat is real.  I was down state near the NC border driving in a two lane divided highway.  I was going 82 and never ever realized it until the officer told me.  GET A LAWYER and go to court.  The attorney advised me to get my car calibrated (the speedometer checked against the actual speed).  I told him the car was pretty new and doubted it would be off.  He said do it anyway.  Well $70 later I had a calibration that told me my car was perfectly tuned.  I went to court and simply by having had the calibration the judge reduced the violation from reckless driving to faulty equipment - a non moving violation.  Net result was that I paid around $100 court costs and fines.  Nothing reported on my driving record, my insurance rates stayed the same. \r\n  \r\nGranted, I had not had a ticket for 5 years prior to that and I'm sure that had an impact on the judge as well.  But the lawyer said that the judge needed the calibration so he could "hang his hat on it"   \r\n  \r\nBy the way, NOTHING I would have done or said would have softened the officer in any way writing the ticket.  As the saying goes - "Tell it to the judge"

Our waiter took the order, I asked that the appetizer, soup, be brought out ahead of the meal. The waiter put the order in, and went to talk to friends of his parents. After more than 25 minutes, another waiter told us that was our waiter, several tables away, chatting up the older couple. I got his attention, and after a lengthy goodbye, he went to get our order. A half cup of soup, both dinners, cold, no rolls, no extra napkins we asked for, all delivered at the same time, and he hid out in the kitchen until we finished. I complained to the manager. I also contacted the restaurant company headquarters. They sent me a gift card in the amount of our purchase. Never saw the waiter again.

Half of what comes out Romney's mouth are lies or distorted views depending on whoever he is speaking with.  And on the other side of the his mouth, he is constantly spewing insensitive messages and unthinkable positions on what Americans go through on a daily basis that he can't relate too.  I know his mouth was filled with a silver spoon throughout his life but someone like this SHOULD NOT be this close to running this country!  When are people going to catch on.  Tuesday night could be a very bad thing and another disastrous storm for ALL fifty states with him winning this election.

It's fine for a pregnant woman to have a drink or two once in a while. Most doctors agree that this does absolutely no harm to the unborn child. However, drinking until passing out, as the woman in the story above did, is a very bad thing to do while pregnant. It's not real smart to do it even if you're not pregnant, either.

Its a sad day for Country Music....I agree that Swift is cute and a good role model...but talent? \r\nShe is one of those celebrities who is fortunate enough (there are many) to capitalize off the poor taste and low standards that most young people now exhibit.  Young people are like " moths caught up in the glare of lights from the low rent section (bad music)."  Just because there is light being shed doesn't mean its a notable place to hang out.  I wait for each one of her songs to come out hoping the beat will change...it doesn't.  Country Music tolerates her because she brings in the $$'s and the media and both feed those enormous egos.

You know that Bernanke is there until 2014, right?  And it's not like there's much in the way of fiscal stimulus happening right now.  That's the reason Bernanke is being so hamfisted about it.  It's broad policies that are trying to activate remote segments of the market.  The Fed can't create demand, only enable demand that's priced out of the market.  Fiscal policy can create demand.

So, you can read people's minds, that is a wonderful talent. I wish I had it. Also, who else is going to sue Hershey? That is how companies have to be stopped when dealing with unfair labor practices. Hershey said they would stop doing business with the farms who were using child labor but, they didn't so, obviously they can not be relied  upon  to keep their word and, the only other alternative is legal action. It's not rocket science, ya know. Companies are not good at "self policing", if it effects their bottom line.. It's sad and it sucks but, that is the reality of it.  Children's welfare has to come first. Seriously, if we can't even be decent to kids then what hope is there for any of us, at all.

They say God works in mysterious ways... \r\n  \r\nThey ALSO say Lawyers are the tool of Satan (It's true, some say that) \r\n  \r\nHere's the thing - IF YOU BELIEVE, then you must ALSO believe thet the statue falling and crushing David's leg was all part of God's plan and he should not sue. \r\n  \r\nHOWEVER, maybe it is ALSO part of God's plan to aLLOW David to sue. MAYBE it was God's plan to give David's wife cancer, and then to cure her so that David would volunteer to clean the statue, thus exascerbating the already poor condition of the anchoring system. If the statue wasn't stable to begin with, then there's a gOOD chance it was going to fall on its own in the near future. There's also a chance someone could have been killed. \r\n  \r\nPerhaps all of this is God's master plan to save the life of the person who would otherwise have been killed by this crucifix, and perhaps David's ability to file the lawsuit is ALSO part of God's plan to compensate him for saving that life. \r\n  \r\nPersonally, it is my belief that this is a tit-for-tat situation where God saved David's wife, but then took his leg as a test of his faith. The Bible is literally FULL of similar stories. David suing the church demonstrates David's desire to strike back at God, rather than accept his fate. \r\n  \r\nThis is only a theory, as I would never presume to know what God is thinking. There are some, however, that would argue that God does not work that way. Perhaps THEY know what God is thinking? \r\n  \r\nI'll bet if you asked them, they would say 'yes'. \r\n  \r\nGregSki

Bob you're an idiot, and apparantly have never been through something like this either. Steve has the right attitude. And yes I've been through something like this, lost power for days, no gas, cell phones didn't work, and what few places were open only took cash as credit cards didn't work. We were warned ahead of time that it was going to be bad there would be large power outages. I had cash and a full tank of gas in my truck and as soon as it was safe to leave the house I was busy helping friends that lost everything. It was the hardest thing I've ever been through and I was still grateful to have a bed to sleep in and the option to take a cold shower. I have little sympathy for people that are cold, hungry, and thirsty. Grocery stores stock water, canned foods, and batteries ahead of time. Don't wait until after the fact to stary crying 'poor me'. People need to start taking care of themselves instead of waiting for everyone else to bail them out.

That looks like different handwriting, so Id say who ever the waiter was decided to be a butt and write that in himself. Also, since there is no tip there included on the receipt, there is no reason not to believe that she left it in cash on the table instead. That is how I tip whomever is waiting on me, because I dont trust the restaurant to give them the tip I intended. Cash that they can count and know what is theirs is much more trustworthy. And just because she is a single mom, if she was, doesnt mean that she was there with a dozen kids, or with friends and they take turns paying, or that her children are grown and they paid for it. So take it easy. Very hard to read hard facts from a single picture.

The word "theory" in science does not mean "speculation" or "especially doubtful."\r\n\r\nCreationists and other science illiterates habitually misrepresent the terms "law" and "theory." The distinction between law and theory is function, not degree of certainty. Laws describe; theories explain. A scientific law is a generalized description of observations (facts).  A scientific theory is a well-supported explanation of HOW something occurs.  The Germ Theory of Disease was, is, and will ALWAYS be a theory, because it explains the cause of some diseases.  But it is a fact that some germs cause some diseases.\r\n\r\n"[Creationists] make it sound as though a 'theory' is something you dreamt up after being drunk all night."  -- Isaac Asimov.

And by the way, if you are in a bad relationship -- remember -- you "can't fix crazy."  If someone is on drugs, abusive, an alcoholic -- don't hang around, thinking you can help that person.  Just pack your bags.  If you are afraid, wait until he goes out to get his **** drunk or goes out to see his other girlfriend.  Safest way to handle a situation, in my point of view.  Keep quiet, pretend to go along with stuff, but secretly get your stuff in order, keep your credit cards / cash / birth certificate / passport, stuff you might need, in your purse, be ready to make a run for it when he's out at a bar or something...  have a safe place to go to already planned.  Plan your escape, but quietly.  Don't keep hoping an abusive person will change.  Set up your own bank account, don't make someone you don't completely trust "joint" on anything financial.  Have your own car.  Tell friends or family or people you trust you are getting ready to leave.  Have a plan.  Don't confront someone who's crazy and violent.  Don't bother to argue, don't get in his face.  You could get hurt.  When he's drunk & out of it comatose on the couch, pack a bag, grab your purse, take the cat if you think he'll put Kitty in the microwave, and leave.  If you don't have a car, call a taxi cab.  There's "50 ways to leave your lover."  Make a new plan, Stan.  Don't need to be Coy, Roy.  Just hop on the bus, Gus...  Don't need to discuss much.  Just drop off the key, Lee.  And get yourself free!  (Lyrics from an old song, I don't know who wrote it, but words to live by.)  -- Rose

Never said anything about cotton candy,gummi bears,rainbow hair, or dildos. \r\nI am a wise non church drone . \r\nI don't believe in religion, God also hates it. \r\nI do believe That God so loves you, He sent His one and only begotten Son so that all who believe in Him will not parish, but will have eternal life. \r\nFor God did not send His Son into the world that He might condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him. 18 Anyone who believes in Him is not condemned, but anyone who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the One and Only Son of God. \r\nPay close attention to the last sentence. \r\nYou see;  It's your choice.  God the Father, Jesus His only Son, and The Holy Spirit Do Exist. \r\nMy prayer again is this;  That God deal with you in a matter in which you would believe and repent

What leadership will you get with a president whose only allowed to rubber stamp conservative agenda? From a speech by Grover Norquist.\r\n  \r\nAll we have to do is replace Obama. ... We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don't need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. We want the Ryan budget. ... We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don't need someone to think it up or design it. The leadership now for the modern conservative movement for the next 20 years will be coming out of the House and the Senate.\r\n \r\nThe requirement for president?\r\n \r\nPick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become president of the United States. This is a change for Republicans: the House and Senate doing the work with the president signing bills. His job is to be captain of the team, to sign the legislation that has already been prepared

I agree with Floleo - build your  homes away from flood plains, beaches without adequate sea-wall protection - people must realize that owning a home close to water - especially where the  geographical formations are such that there is little protection from erosion or low-lying land, is asking for disastrous  results.  Maybe it's time to look at the overall permit structure so homes are not allowed to be built in areas where damage from storm surges is likely to  be the result.  Of course, insurance companies want the big bucks for insuring homes that are at hight risk and the rest of us pay for that through higher house insurance premiums.  Wake up, people.

I love Kelly Clarkston, but why is she a part of the CMA's? She is not a Country artist! Not to mention nominated for an award? Geeze!  What is wrong with Country Music? You really can't even tell what the artists sound like with most of their songs. Did you notice how great Carrie sounded when she sang a "Classic" country song by Connie Smith? Why are we watering down good ole' country music with all the filler?? The TRUE artists don't need it. Eric Church was the ONLY guy that even sounded country. He was robbed by not winning song or single of the year. And I am sick of Taylor's theatrical performances....they  ​  are just plain stupid and are a disgrace to country music.

What most people don't understand is that our base wage is $2.13 and hour.  How do you expect a waitress to have a smile on her face all day when there are so many ****s out there that feel they don't need to tip.  Do you want to go to work and not get paid?  I have given the best service the customers were completely happy and even told the owner how wonderful I had been, but yet no tip....and then you wonder why there is no service and a smile, you have to pay for it.

Not Boring, as much as I love animals & as great as the knee jerk reaction is to support such a change... ultimately, I have to agree that it would lead to things far worse than the occasional pet owner not receiving more & better compensation when something like this happens.\r\nIf one weighs that one pro against the cons (see above post)... it's just not worth it.  Even the argument that the threat of a lawsuit would make these places take greater care is not nearly enough to counter the ill effects.  They are just too many and too far-reaching.\r\n \r\nPeople really need to look into these things and then give them a good, thorough think, before throwing their support behind every (supposedly) 'great idea'.  And, with this one, no animal lover would be for a change in the law if they've done any amount of research.  Because with an honest pet owner who's truly been wronged, it is a bandage on a bullet hole.  And, you've already mentioned what could happen in less desirable situations with a dishonest person... I shudder to think.

Nothing  I have found are as comfortable as this brand and believe me I have paid top dollar for for other footwear. I  agree with everyone here about the price. If they could find a way to reduce that I think more people would buy them. Cheap knock offs don't measure up...I have tried those as well.

Sounds like we will have plenty of time to expose the right wing religious fanatics in Congress who have no interest in avoiding the fiscal cliff in plenty of time. Sad situation we are in because they had the last 2.5 years to look at the President's budget but instead were more concerned with destroying the middle class, abortion rights and Obama's birth certificate. VOTE OBAMA and then VOTE OUT this do-nothing Congress.

What I find disturbing is that the race is a dead heat after all the stupid stuff this man has said, how he's flip-flopped and evaded taking positions except that everything Obama has done, he'll repeal on Day One. Except his foreign policy, Obamacare, etc. Mitt is totally out of touch with normal people. It just doesn't occur to him that someone may lack resources and family to fall back on, that people may have to decide between groceries and enough gas to get to work. Obama gets it. Obama has lived it.

Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent in his third term leading New York City, has been sharply critical of both Mr. Obama, a Democrat, and Mitt Romney, the president’s Republican rival, saying that both men have failed to candidly confront the problems afflicting the nation. But he said he had decided over the past several days that Mr. Obama was the best candidate to tackle the global climate change that the mayor believes contributed to the violent storm, which took the lives of at least 38 New Yorkers and caused billions of dollars in damage.

Scott, \r\n Unemployment is less of a problem than it was 4 years ago. Slow and steady progress is fine by me at this point. The last thing I want is another bubble. Frankly, Romney's grandiose promises scare the hell out of me. When somebody tells you everything you want to hear, something is wrong. \r\n But I think we are missing the bigger picture on unemployment. Unemployment among the educated is low. For those with a Bachelor's degree it's about 5%.  \r\n It's the uneducated work force that is suffering. I think many of them are waiting for high paying factory jobs to come back to their town. Sorry, that train has left the station. And unemployment benefits are competitive with minimum wage work, so a lot of people choose not to work. \r\n The key to getting unemployment down is taking away unemployment benefits (99 weeks is ridiculous) and promoting education and job training. \r\n But this will not be a quick fix for whoever ends up as president. And whoever does end up as president will take credit as the economy continues to recover over the next 4 years.

now republicans this is what a true person does and something Mr Romney could never do it is totaly agaisnt his belief. the dollar come before the human's  why else would you layoff workers and send their factory to china as  ceo of bain capatial. As of now 95% of all goverment workers that have been layed off in the last four years have come from  Republican run states, this is just another example of republican beliefs, the people dont matter it is the money that matters. the problem with that thinking is they cant seem to save any money either. as fast as they cut the poor and middle class , just as fast do they give it away to business and the rich. perhaps the good deed that this hotel owner is doing will not go noticed by your party but this is the kind of man the republican party needs instead of ryan -romney greed

She is lucky she was in line with the election staff's views. She should have been arrested, as the shirt was in clear violation of the law (and, by the by, where are the conservatives who rail about the "law is the law"?). Instead, she was allowed in the polling place, succeeded in her desire to attract attention to her cause, given a jacket, and allowed to vote.\r\n \r\nIf anything, the people who failed to have her arrested should be charged. The woman should also be charged, as it is still within the window for doing so. She is not deserving of an apology--she's deserving of a few days in jail and a big lawyer's bill.\r\n \r\nOne is not supposed to have a car bumper sticker (as someone else noted) or a lapel button or anything like that within 100 feet of a polling place. I'm sure it occasionally happens (it used to happen that we had to park within 100 feet of the place we voted, though there was a wall between where we were and the polling place.  We now have to vote elsewhere, and it may well be to keep the cars more than 100 feet away from the actual spot where people vote.\r\n \r\nBut, yeah, little Miss "Vote the Bible" should cool her heels in the county jail for a couple of days and figure out that you shouldn't complain when everyone is already bending over backwards (and violating the law) to allow you to vote.

I am 60 years old and I like many others have witnessed the death of true country music.  many years ago the nashville connection wanted to distance themselves from "hillbilly" music--wasnt selling. then they shunned Willie, Waylon, Chris Kristoferson, and others like them because the said that these artists "did not represent country".  now they change again probably so they can make more money, well i wouldnt waste a dime on the garbage i heard last night!!!!!

Twenty-nine years ago, I was 19 years old and going to college for an associate degree & "this guy" commanded me (yeah, that's right) to marry him.  He wanted me to quit college, quit my job, and stay home to have babies.  "You're gonna do what I say, and you're gonna marry me!"  I definitely had no interest in this Neanderthal (oh, maybe that insults Neanderthals, maybe they were more advanced than this guy), so I figured, if I stay in college, he'll get bored with me and find a new hobby, like some other poor fool girl who will marry him.  I said, "I want to finish college first, okay?"  He said, "No wife a mine gonna go to no college.  You gonna do what you're told, and you're gonna marry me!"    I said, "You know, if you talk that way to me, I'm gonna leave you."  "You'll never leave me.  You can't live five minutes without me.  You'll just come crawling back."  He only talked like this when there were no other people around.  When other people were around, he was a perfect gentleman.   I knew if I married him, my life would be hell.  I stayed in college.  My friends were angry with me for not marrying him, they said, "You are so stupid!  You coulda stayed home and he'd pay the bills!  Why did you leave him?  You don't need college!"  I got my associate degree, then went nights and got my bachelor's.  I got a good job, then got "downsized."  I used the time off to go to paralegal school and got a third college degree.  I am so thankful every day that I stayed in college.  I have a career and own a home and I have travelled to Europe, Africa, Canada, and other places.  I am self-supporting and control my own life.  Every day, I thank God that He gave me the common sense to make the right decision.  So many girls would be young and gullible with all this romantic nonsense that movies and romance novels put in their silly heads -- I would say a good percentage of girls would be thrilled to marry a guy, even if he was a jerk, because everything in "the media" (books, TV, movies) convince girls that jerks will change and they really love them, yada-yada-freakity-y  ​ ada...    Well, guess what?  For the past three decades I've seen a lot of people trapped in rotten hellish marriages. \r\n  \r\nGirls who are reading this:  If someone is a jerk, leave before it's too late.  Go to school.  Learn a job skill if you can't afford college.  Be able to support yourself.  And don't be afraid to leave an abusive relationship.  I left an abusive man and I thank God every day that I did.  Don't let someone manipulate you or control you, even if he keeps saying that he "loves you."  If someone loves you, he doesn't make you feel bad about yourself.  Don't throw away your future for some guy's false promises that he'll take care of you.

Only way we will get rid of her is to ignore her. Attention is her power and ignoring her is her kryptonite.\r\nI think its time

Then BEFORE eating at the establishment, find out if your server is actually earning a wage to "do their job."  Or take a look at the federal and state minimum wage laws posted at your employer.  You will probably notice that the minimum wage for "tipped employees" is usually around HALF THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR A NON TIPPED EMPLOYEE.  There just aren't enough restaurant owners who pay a "tipped" employee to do their Job.

There is plenty of risk with a debit card.  Fraud protection on a debit card is completely different, and often non-existent compared to a credit card.   \r\n  \r\nAnd $300 a year cash back is a little more then a "few bucks." \r\n  \r\nIf you loose your job, you would be in the EXACT SAME financial position with a debit card as you would be with a credit card, so that argument holds no water.  Sorry.  \r\n  \r\nI treat my credit card just like a debit card.  I only buy what I can afford to pay for.  The only difference is that I get paid big bucks to do it.  My debit card doesn't pay me anything.

It has nothiing to do with my thoughts about her personally, but she is stiff and when questions are asked of the judges, it is painfully obvious that she is reading a script and its really bad. Simon you're gonna lose people. The other one that is completely driving me nuts is Demi OH PULEEZ the next time I hear her say I see it behind your eyes blaa blaa blaa oh I'll strangle her!

@PaxPax-\r\n \r\nProve it.  While you're at it, explain to me why Venus and Mars are also getting statistically warmer, and have been for the past half century.  Pretty sure there aren't any SUVs or coal burning factories on either of those planets.

there is a reason those "stick models" are on magazine covers and why the horse is on the back of a busted up car.  people buy the magazines because the models look good and that car is going to be written off as totaled.

Metalhead who is #1 then? China? India? Obama has done more good in 4 years than Bush did in 8. What EXACTLY has he destroyed? He's spent 4 years getting everything back on track and it's almost there, but if you fools put Mitt in office, things will go back to the way they were 8 years ago, with $5 a gallon gas, no jobs, and people living in the street.\r\n \r\nThe Repubs put people in the sitution to have to have government assistance to survive, and then sit back and b!tch and cry like little girls if people actually use that assistance. Is more of that what you want? Cuz I don't....I want to move.....FORWARD.

So the pizza guy gets $5.00 for driving to the house of a generous customer and exchanging three words with him, and the waitress who makes her living by being courteous and attentive gets stiffed on a $140.00 - a hundred and forty dollar!!! - meal.  Some people expect a tip just for interacting with the general public at a cash register.  Some people like to abuse a waitress for an hour and a half and then stiff them half their wages for the effort.  The tipping culture in this country is so out of whack.  Come to think of it, I think it's pretty representative :\

That it will take alot longer to get the basic back up and running... and that there are those people to take advantage of the good folks there ( even though the media and officials are doing a good job of covering that up) crime is an issue. Keeping warm is an issue, food is an issue, water is an issue. OH yeah lets not forget your insurance companies squirming out of paying your claims... Good luck to all of you. \r\nSo what I saying is forget about this girl in the photo, poor taste, yes but, forget about it you have much bigger troubles...maybe your mayor Bloomburg should give the mayor of Miami a call for some advice..\r\nBoy your mayor there in NY is a real pip.... knows everything ... good for him.

Here's what you can expect in retirement: Nobody will care about you personally, but they will care about (and resent you for) how much money you have. Every scam artist in the country will ignore the do-not -call list and bother you daily trying to get your money. The IRS will pester you for more money. The politicians will game the system against your retirement income sources since "that's where the money is".  Your routine bills will increase year after year. People will assume you're both stupid and out of touch. All the expenses of life will increase, and all your income resources will shrink. People will resent you if you don't suffer as appropriately as they may deem proper. People will write stupid articles like this one while not knowing one more thing about what the future may bring to the economy than you do. The dollar will be diluted as politicians and the Bernanke types try to stave off fiscal disasters of their own making. Happy retirement.

It's sad commentary of our day that one must adapt to brutal cynicism to accommodate economic reality, but alas, such is the requirement of our lives in order to maintain a steady fiscal personal compass. Unlike Army's comments above, I don't find the need to declare poverty in order to keep the pocket-pickers out of my assets, however I do acknowledge that his proximity to the New York system may indeed require this behavior of him in order to keep them from picking his bones clean before he's  through using them, especially now that the Northeast has been visited by new needs for even  higher taxes. I'm sure those needs will find their way to justify higher taxes and insurance rates for us all.

Observations of a man.................  ​ .I find more and more women are doing work on advanced degrees.  I can't say the same is true of men.    I've always felt that women are smarter than men but men are stronger and expected to support a family, thus we have historically had the best jobs even though there were lots of women supporting and taking care of families.  Things are "achangin" and women are now pursuing the same jobs men have but in order to do so, they have to have better credentials.  Not fair but true.    \r\n \r\nAnd btw, in case any of my fellow men haven't noticed.............  ​ .women are starting to be a force in politics.  You male chauvanists better wear your tight underwear and keep them tucked in!  We've run the world for centuries and screwed it up worse and worse.  I'd like to see what a woman could do as president.

Unlike the forthright corporations and businesses, right? Who shipped jobs overseas in the name of higher profits and polluted our environment when there were no regulations and now instead of being "responsible for their actions" like the conservatives always want individuals to be, many delcare bankruptcy and leave the clean up of their toxic waste to the federal government if it gets cleaned up at all. Does this mean I am blindly pro union? No! But I am also not blindly pro no regeulations on businesses. We need to work together to come up with a good balance between the two extremes. I don't understand why most people have become like little kids on the playground who have to have it their way and their way only or they take their ball and go home so no one can have a good time. It's called working together people. Compromise is not a bad word - it is how things used to get done.

Dear atheists and everyone:  \r\n God loves you.  \r\n I'm not going to judge anyone for not believing, but I personally choose to believe because the reward is living in Heaven and God gives everyone blessings, even if they may not see it. I'm the kind of Christian to pray and love people, not to point forceful fingers. Whether you come to God or not is your choice, but know that God will be waiting if you change your mind. Prayers and thoughts to anyone being affected by Hurricane Sandy, and for any situation.  \r\n I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me-Phillipians 4:13

They forgot another way to get free movies and television. A certain device currently on the market allows people to receive television channels, including some not on included with most cable and satellite services, absolutely free - RIGHT OUT OF THIN AIR! Often hidden away on the back shelves, it goes by many names; the slang term, "rabbit ears", is common among habitual users. It works on any set in any room in the house; you can even use it outdoors! Some addicts have even been known to increase the effects by adding aluminum foil, which is still legally available in many stores.

I am sorry but if it was I in the situation, in the officer's shoes that is, I know for sure I would want to teach that disrespectful brat a lesson but I do not know about using a Taser on the child. I'd just pull out my 9 mil and teach him a real life lesson. LOL I am just joking, don't get your panties out of whack. Why is everyone siding for the child, and saying the parents should sue? Hello, to the parents of the child, my question to you is, "Why is the heck do you have a 10 year old child who thinks he can disrespect the police, much less any other authority figure?" Perhaps Mom and Dad passed that little attitude down, you learn what you live. If your, obviously angelic child watches those around him (which should be his parents at his age) and those same people disrespect and sh*t-talk about the police, how is that child going to grow up to become??? This attitude from the kids today is abhorrent. There is absolutely no respect (obviously I'm speaking in generalities, I know there are exceptions to the rule) for other people, other's possessions, heck...even their lives sometime. I don't think this cop should be on leave and I don't think this child has been so horribly, mentally injured that he's afraid....hey a*hole, maybe the next time a cop tells you to do something, you'll pull up your saggin' pants, and do what you are told. If at 10 you have already got the, "ain't nobody gonna tell me what to say" someone needs to knock some fear into you. I think the Taser did its job. Perhaps, little boy, you are faced with a similar situation, you will certainly remember that lesson and do whatever it is the police ask you to do-even if they say act like a chicken laying an egg. Responsibility for your child's behavior is directly related to how the child was treated and raised as a child. I don't want to hear this boo-hoo crap. I would do the same IN A HEARTBEAT. I am sure he learned the meaning of respect after he was done pissing his pants due to the 50K volts he just received. Be a good parent, teach your children right, and stop looking for someone to blame for everything. Ugh

I think it is about time and I hope that the rest of the country and then the world will soon come to ban all forms of animal mills and backyard breeders.  Animals are to be loved and cared for - they are not meant for profit.  All forms of animal mills are nothing more then torture for the animals.  Responsible licensed pure bred breeders are the only to purchase pure bred animals.  Rescue and shelter animals will always be the best way to add a new family member.   Save an animals life and let them save you.

Can u explain to me y u and others r calling this couple all kinds of names and making comments about their character? Because I'm confused as to y someone can't have fun after a disaster. Is she supposed to sit around helpless whining about all the damage and destruction? Cause I'm almost certain the one of the best traits about mankind is the ability to overcome problems. Therefore y r u and others so hell bent on trying to keep her down?

Actually women are just showing how shallow most of them really are. Smart men don't get married only the hen pecked ones do, also known as the mommas boys. Marriage life is a "hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"  and women use this excuse to their advantage along with pms all typical excuses to act like a bitch.

I went through the same thing with a friend. Moved her and her kid out, got them set up in a new place, all that. One month later she was back with him. I guess she thought things would change? That relationship ended up costing her custody of her son, and she eventually left the guy for good. She found out a few years later that he would come by every night and unscrew her porch light and sit there and watch her though the windows (she thought the light fixture had a short in it). After a lot of therapy, she finally got right about it and realized how destructive the relationship had been. In a lot of cases I think the physical moving is only half the battle - for it to really work you have to work at undoing the mental f*ck the abuser has done as well.

Child labor is a HUGE terrible problem all over the world from Africa, to India, and Asia!  At one time, countries like France, UK, Spain,... would actual invade a country to colonize it just so they can forcce people to work as slaves under gun point.  This same practice has taken several face-lifts and name changes, but the procedure is still the same - forced child labor.\r\n.\r\nThose of you that are making light of this situation might regret one day.  Just imagine that you have two young daughters age 5 and 7, instead of being in school, they are forced to work out in the farm, factories...  \r\n \r\nI don't know how to fix this problem, but we can start by not making it worse.  Global free trade is not happing.

How can anyone call that country music?  Hank, Roy, Marty, Johnny, so many more are rolling over in their graves.  Only thing worth watching was Willy, and the tribute made to Connie Smith.  Now that is country and what CMA should stand for.  The other music has its place but not  under the label of  "Country Music".  I know this is a younger generation but then let the Country to those left to best represent it.  George Strait, Alan Jackson, George Jones and a few others still with us, and when they are gone don't call it country anymore. With all the technology you techies can figure out a new name for the music.

An old saying from my father, "It's not how much you make, but how you manage what you make".  In other words, someone making $50,000 a year can't live like someone making $75,000.00 a year.  Live within your means.  Always live on less than you make. And, save, save, save.

You guys do know there is a big difference between children working on a family farm and children trapped in slavery being forced to work industrial farms at gunpoint...right?\r\n \r\nHershey's also ran a scam in which they offered work/study programs to teens in developing countries. For a hefty sum the families could send their children to PA, but once there the kids were paid only pocket change, slept a large number in substandard dorms and were virtually trapped on Hershey's property. If they complained the company threatened to deport them. \r\n \r\nYes, the Hershey forebearers are twirling furiously by now. That's what happens when you allow companies to run with NO regulation or oversight.

GGG702,\r\nWhat you said makes no sense and is not based on anything in the article, but stems from your imagination and your own personal baggage.  There was no mention of men in the article, the restaurant customer was not trying to make a man kiss her butt - presumably she was out with her kids and no man was present.  And the whole point was that she did not have a man paying for her meal, that's why she gave the excuse that she was a single mom as an explanation for not leaving a tip.

What a stupid question! Hell no. This idiot was playing with the weapon, and probably not accustomed to the proper handling of firearms. William and Kate are lucky he didn't accidentally shoot one of them instead. This is one of the dangers of a truly restrictive gun control policy such as the one they have over there. People are totally unfamiliar with pistols, rifles, etc, and do not have the respect for them that they should. I am sure he was admiring the toy he had been entrusted with; imagining shooting an IRA assassin or Al Qaida member, and was genuinely surprised when it discharged. He could easily shot his partner, too. I would ask for a different one if I was the other guy.

"October surprise: Sandy + Jobs report = Obama final boost! See you guys tomorrow during the jobs report"   Apparently, helping NY & NJ is an anti-Romney contagion. Obama picks up NYC Bloomberg's endorsement and the backing of millions nationwide for his proactive work during the disaster--- I hear whole states are changing their minds and supporting the President. In fact, they are also supporting anyone but a **** Republican in Congress... suggesting a clean sweep. Are you reading this Rover? Better go lick some Koches crotches to get more slander and mudslinging bucks. That's got to smell and taste nasty... but only you would know. America is getting immune to TV commercials. TiVO works! I hear the Bushes are having Romney ads printed on the inside cover of bibles and sending Mormons door to door in Ohio to beg for votes or can goods that Romney will drop in a bucket for a photo op ($1,000 cash, no checks). Laura Bush is out stumping... she's been heard to say "if you can't get their vote, run them over with your car. Use MY lawyer."  Adelson has a new slot machine at the Bellagio... you put promises of jobs in it and it takes $5 Trillion out of your bank account... unless your account is offshore, then it asks for a million Ben Bernanke fiat bucks or a $1 token, whichever you still think are worth more. Word is-- the entire Party of NO is still on a golf vacation. None have taken one shot yet because all have too many handicaps and no balls. The guy they hired to keep score just quit. Everytime he raised his hand toward paper, they would all yell "no, don't sign that" and handed him a cool million in lobby bucks to comply. So he did and now owns his own Cayman Island.

The so-called "obstruction" by the GOP may be the only thing saving the middle class from Obama and the democrats. \r\nBarack Obama is a community organizer. He knows how to grow division and class warfare. He knows nothing of growing economies. Left alone in control, democrats created policies that were not only not helpful to the economy and the middle class, they are harmful.

Are you serious?  I'll agree that long distance relationships don't work for long, but men don't chase women for very long anyway.  He will only stay as long as she is perfect-hair, nails, cute outfits, no bigger than a size 8 and does what she's told. The man will marry this perfect girl and complain as soon as he sees the bills for this upkeep. To keep this guy, she keeps working and hands her babies over to daycare at six weeks. Her in-laws will hate her, but what choice is there?  If you stay at home to take care of the kids, good luck finding a job when the kids go to school.  A man may be able to earn a decent living doing manual labor, but a woman usually can't.  So she gets a degree and tries to get by and pay her way. \r\n I've been a stay at home mom for awhile. My husband wanted it that way.  I drive an old car without A/C,  I have never had a manicure and I haven't had a vacation for 7 years. I have NEVER complained to my husband.  He has kept his job in a bad economy and I count our blessings.  I can only hope that my husband doesn't meet the "perfect girl" and decide that I don't measure up despite my best efforts.  When my youngest starts school next fall,  I will try to squeeze my way back into the job market.  His degree, plus 15 years in the field, gives him a little security. My degree, plus 8 years at home with the kids, MIGHT keep me from asking "Do you want fries with that?" \r\nBeing a nice married woman with children and no education is dangerous.

Alex, go and get your meds and take them. Also quit believing just any ole thing you read online, it's not healthy. As far as "... Chinese were prepared to send their "people" to American shores to seize property", well, I think the Navy and the Marines can keep the Chinese away. Of course, if you mean legal recourse, they'd hire US lawyers for that. But bankruptcy is what stops US lawyers, so worthless financial instruments are NOT an instrument of international coercion. Get real!

Royal...It will all be about Recovery...Which will mean "just about all" Economic indicators will be pulling the same direction...FORWARD,  ​  nice ring,right.?  hmmmmm.\r\n \r\nMany of the savers left the Markets, ma&pa, the widows and other stable players; That has been a big problem since 2007-2008 when old money got scared, and many were trying to save as much of their retirements as possible....They got scared, they had bad advice and now they don't trust anyone.\r\nSlowly some are coming back, but many have billions or trillions still out of equities..\r\nThe Markets are trending and now somewhat overbought, but corrections are good for a moving long term trends..\r\nMarkets are very volitile because of the short term traders,scumbags,hed  ​ ge funds and massive injections in and out with Trading platforms...And old money is still scared...Bad advice.

Actually, Lazarus and Molly Rowe of Limington Maine were, and are, according to the Guiness Book, the longest married couple in the U.S. at just over 86 years to my knowledge. They both lived over a 100 and saw their family to its 5th generation.\r\n \r\n  Consequently, Lazarus also escaped being captured by indians, his brother did not, and as history would say, saved by a spide's web when he crawled into a hollow log to hide from the indians, the spider then spun a web over the end before they arrived and never looked into the log thinking the web was there.\r\n \r\nGoogle it, it is everywhere and I am originally from Limington, Maine

The provision that establishes this tax can be found on page 946, Section 1402 of the Affordable Care Act.  This tax is often referred to as the “Medicare tax,” because it was designed to raise funds for Medicare. The Medicare tax goes into effect after December 30, 2012.\r\nThe Medicare tax is not a tax on all new home sales; it only applies to the profit that certain high income Americans make from the sale of their home.  The groups that may be affected by this provision are individuals with annual incomes over $200,000 and married couples with a joint income of over $250,000. The only home sellers who will be affected by this provision are those who fit the above description, and who sell their home for a profit of more than $250,000. The tax will not apply to the first $250,000 in profits for the individual selling his or her home or to the first $500,000 in profits for a married couple.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce again decide for yourself, there is truth in both sides.   But it sure appears if your family income is over 200,000 you will be clobbered by this tax.   This will have the effect the vast majority, because in future, these numbers are not adjusted for inflation.  This like the income tax when started  didn't effect 90% of those working, but  as the government inflated, more and more people were taxed.   So in effect, within 20 years almost everyone will pay this tax.

Here is what I want to Know. I hear about all the things being donated to NY & NJ. Money coming in. Is this going to be like New Orleans and Haiti. All the Billion's donated. In Haiti people are still Living in Tents. Bush and Clinton raised Millions, SO WHERE DID THE MONEY GO.\r\nIn New Orleans, Clinton gave 95 Billion to fix the Levies, Where did the Money go? Billions donated to help , Where did the Money go? I gave $3,500. myself. But two days later I heard the Black Caucus making a Racial Issue out of it and than I wanted my Money back. I didn't send money to help Just White People . I did it to help everyone who needed help Black, White or what ever.

I think this little boy learned a valuable lesson.  Obvioulsy his parents didn't teach him to respect authority, and they are probably a couple of rebels themselves.  That's what is wrong with this country, no respect for authority and no respect for the rules.  Congressman and senators have no respect for the oaths of office that they took to represent the voters, the police have no respect for the people and people have no respect for authority.  This is all the fault of creedy, crooked politicians.  Crap rolls down hill.  The little boy should learn respect for authority, who should in turn respect the people that should replace all those crooks in Congress.  Then maybe stupid crap like this won't happen.

Wow!  I just can see why  gays are so angry!  I mean they're being told in the nicest, mostly loving way possible that they don't deserve the same rights that the rest of us take for granted - that their children should be denied health care, that their loved ones can't visit them as family in the hospital, that their loved ones are denied survivor benefits, etc.  It's all done in COMPLETE LOVE, of course, because the religious zealots say they really love the sinner, but hate only the sin!  It's love, because they SAY it's LOVE!\r\n\r\nIn fact, they're told that their marriage isn't real, that their love isn't real, but only lust - because the zealots - THEY know what real love is!  And they know what the ONLY TRUTH is!  The zealots say they trust GOD more than they trust men, but what they REALLY trust is their own fallible, personal, HUMAN judgement that the Bible is the word of god.  "NO! NO! NO!" They say, they're not trusting their judgement, but the word of god, oblivious to the fact that it's THEIR OWN FALLIBLE HUMAN JUDGEMENT that their assessment is correct.  They continually hope to elevate their judgement above human judgement - to the perfect judgement of god!\r\n\r\nIn their great 'humility" and 'love' they pass on god's judgement - not their own judgement, but GOD's judgement.  They are merely the communicators.  You see, logic is not their strong point.  Neither is evidence or morality, nor in fact humility or love.  The zealots do, however, have certain characters in great abundance - hubris, arrogance, contempt, hypocrisy.

We lived in Milan for 3 years and couldn't believe they even let McDonalds in the Galleria.  Who needs that kind of food, when there are lots of fast foods "Italian style".  Every corner has coffee shop bars where sandwiches are made with fresh made breads and fabulous fresh meats, cheeses, herbs and vegetables.  There are still lots of other McDonalds around town so they will survive.

well i'm only 19 years old never been married, never done the nasty ,had one date, never even kissed a girl. but that doesn't mean i don't know what can make a marriage work, ever since i was young i was lonely parents were gone i was left in the house watching cartoons and i always wished i had someone who makes me feel like everythings gonna be okay, made me smile, made the good days even better! then as i got older i began to think on who do i want to be? what do i want to do to make her stay? what can i do to make her smile? all these and so much more raced through my mind and i still have so much i have got to learn and experience before then. i also still have to work on who i am as a person before then so i can have what theresa faiss and her husband have. i don't think "yeah i'm 19 it's not gonna happen to me!" i think "gods probably got me waiting so i can understand what it truly means to cherish someone!" and for that i'm happy. and i know one day i'm going to make it work!

Hmm an average of 12 million viewers per show, making it the most watched sitcom on TV tells it all.  People who whine to get Charlie Sheen back are narrow minded and just cannot see past Charlie and enjoy the show in its new light.  Live a little, try something new, it wont hurt.  Ashton is a great actor and has proven it over the years, since he is still here and making money.  And the wonderful supporting cast that was there with Charlie Sheen is still there and it makes for a really great show, (as the numbers prove).

continued from my last post:   NEWS FLASH ....HERE'S THE REAL MYTH ROBME.... \r\n  The profit from the Romney's Delphi fund investment, through a hedge fund, came about as the result of extorting the federal government, according to Palast's account: \r\n Yet without taking billions in taxpayer bailout funds—and slashing worker pensions—the hedge funds’ investment in Delphi would not have been worth a single dollar, according to calculations by GM and the US Treasury. \r\n Altogether, in direct and indirect payouts, the government padded these investors’ profits handsomely. The Treasury allowed GM to give Delphi at least $2.8 billion of funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to keep Delphi in business. GM also forgave $2.5 billion in debt owed to it by Delphi, and $2 billion due from Singer and company upon Delphi’s exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The money GM forgave was effectively owed to the Treasury, which had by then become the majority owner of GM as a result of the bailout. Then there was the big one: the government’s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation took over paying all of Delphi’s retiree pensions. The cost to the taxpayer: $5.6 billion. The bottom line: the hedge funds’ paydays were made possible by a generous donation of $12.9 billion from US taxpayers. \r\n Of course, once the hedge fund Romney was invested in shook the feds down for billions, they went to work on destroying jobs. Where did they ship most of the work. Why, who would have thunk it? China. Back to Palast: \r\n Rattner [the auto bailout czar] could not believe that Delphi’s management—now effectively under the hedge funders’ control—would “want to be perceived as holding GM hostage at such a precarious economic moment.” One Wall Street Journal analyst suggested that Singer was treating Delphi “like a third world country.” Rattner likened the subsidies demanded by Delphi’s debt holders to “extortion demands by the Barbary pirates.” \r\n Romney has slammed the bailout as a payoff to the auto workers union. But that certainly wasn’t true for the bailout of Delphi. Once the hedge funders, including Singer—a deep-pocketed right-wing donor and activist who serves as chair of the conservative, anti-union Manhattan Institute—took control of the firm, they rid Delphi of every single one of its 25,200 unionized workers. \r\n Of the twenty-nine Delphi plants operating in the United States when the hedge funders began buying up control, only four remain, with not a single union production worker. Romney’s “job creators” did create jobs—in China, where Delphi now produces the parts used by GM and other major automakers here and abroad. Delphi is now incorporated overseas, leaving the company with 5,000 employees in the United States (versus almost 100,000 abroad). \r\n There's much more if you read the Truthout and BuzzFlash at Truthout articles that Palast has revealed about the Romney Delphi windfall. \r\n It's lamentable and unwarranted for the Delphi pensions not to be honored, but if the hedge fund investors who benefited from mugging DC for taxpayer dollars were less greedy, it might have gone another way.  A deal might have been worked out to honor the pensions in questions, as should have happened. \r\n Once again, however, the 1 percent picked the pockets of the 99 percent, and Romney had a bankroll to deposit in his offshore accounts as a result.

Because its a few days before the election.  Part of the four part plan.  Why are expected number of jobs up and unemployment up... hmmm... as long as that number shows a big "7" instead of his new acceptable "8", because people don't know what a decimal is either.\r\nGas doubled, but down a quarter now.... so thats great.

I'm a Bulls' fan and I just put my opinion here like everyone else does. What is the freakin' attitude from you all about? FVCK OFF? dude, chill out, its not THAT serious! some of you sports fans need to get a freakin' life.  reanderson, with all of the money that black brother has, I'm sure your opinion or your not like him, and that includes any other arm-chair coach here makes, mean not a dam thing to him. Get over yourselves, its SPORTS.

My grandfarther was a member of the United BrotherHood of Carpenters & Joiners( UBC ) he worked as a carpenter before the "Great Desperation" until his retirement in 1960s one of the of the projects he worked on was Grand Coolie Dam largest dam in the world,  until the Yang Sea dam,   Most of the big projects he worked he would have to live in labor camps leaving my grandmother to tend to the farm and raise the children. they worked 12 hours a day six and sometimes seven days a week for straight pay with no benefits.   Now thanks to the UBC and other unions that stood up against "Robber Barons"  and there privet army's now even the disorganized labor force have a 40 hour work week and some benefits, but more importantly if those of you that scream so loud about taking away the right to organize looked back in to your own family you might realize that at some point union wages are what payed for your doctor or law degrees.   Another thought to ponder As a nation we use economic means as weapons against other countries so why when someone dissembles U.S. manufacturing, outsources jobs to foreign countries and puts the profits from this in offshore foreign banks why are they not arrested for treason for being economic terrorists?   I am proud to be a member of the UBC, I am proud that I can send my son to collage, I am proud that he has been raised with out welfare I am proud to be one of the builders of America and not one of the destroyers.   One more thing when you talk of corrupt politicians remember who deregulated the savings and loans and used his presidential power to break the air traffic controllers in the 80's.   The reason we are up to our eyes in debt is a direct result of the policies set in the 2000's and a congress unwilling to do anything but try to affix blame on someone other than them self's

So Romney  how to organize people to respond to a problem instead of waiting to have some one else fix everything, and 'you' miss the point ,so that makes him 'stupid' ? I wonder if this review could have been anymore warped and distorted if you tried.  Romney has probably done more personal service to others than anyone in government. You really should not be so jealous of money and real intelligence. Think outside the bias, some how, for once!

My uterus should not even be a topic of conversation for these men! \r\nLet's see what they are discussing in DC: reduced education spending, fighting access to contraceptives and planned parenthood, reducing food stamps or welfare (which primarily only helps signle parents)... sounds to me like they are a bunch of men trying to make women solely dependant upon them. Sounds like "marry me or else"!

This sounds fishy.  Even if you were making $40K 15 years ago, 15% of your take home pay would be less than $6K.  15 years at 6K = 90K.  90K invested 15 years ago at  13% compounded annually would give you $562K.  But I'm sure you weren't making 40K 15 years ago and you were adding money each year, you didn't invest the 90K 15 years ago. \r\n  \r\nAlso, consistent 13% gains over the last 15 years GREATLY exceeds the performance in any broad-based mutual funds that I know of.  For example, the S&P 500 is up only 47% over the last 15 years, compared to the 625% that a 13% compounded annually return would produce. \r\n  \r\nI call BS

I used to leave a tip regardless of the quality service because I felt OBLIGATED to do so. However, that is no longer the case. WAIT STAFF BEWARE! I will stiff you your tip if you give me bad service!! Too many times I go to a resturant and get not bad service but seriously horrible service and I am tired of it! A tip is meant to be a BONUS for good service, a gratuity. Not an additional fee on top of the cost of dinner. It is NOT an entitlement. I no longer eat at resturants that automatically charge a gratuity regardless of the # of people in your party. I do not tip at buffets or cafeterias where I serve myself. If you are waiting on me and you have a bad attitude, take too long to take my order, bring me my order and forget about me til time for the check or any other equally shabby treatment, not only will I not tip you, I'll leave you a note telling you why I didn't! Act like you are working with the public, treat me like a valued customer, and I'll leave you 20-25%.

Now, i do believe its caused by sin, but not just one sin, thats stupid... JONATHAN CAHN talks about this is the ISAIHA 9:10 JUDGMENT! being homosexual is called a sin in the bible but so is judgment and no where in the bible does JESUS say to be little or shame or treat different someone who is gay.. we as christians are called to love and share with the world not to act sinful as we point out others sins... i do believe that judgment comes on us as it did Israel, for us turning from GOD but not just because people are gay, its because our leader,our so called president has allowed people to remove god and not just obama but through out history, GOD is no longer in our schools, on our money and so many other places we have removed him. GOD loves gay people and i believe that wholeheartedly.. i may not agree with that choice and i may promote that life but PASTORS who believe this kinda thing please keep it to yourself... this has caused so many to run from GOD not to him. how can they if you make a person feel they are not good enough to come before GOD!! there is not one person who served the lord that had their stuff together, they where killers and among others who were called while they were messed up and they remained messed up even afterwards why you ask because they where humane, like us... if anyone reads this i hope i've made my point that not all christian may agree but we do not all condemn people for sins when we sin everyday no matter the sin a sin is a sin... NOT PERFECT BUT FORGIVEN, AND SO ARE YOU!!

Political scientist Boots Riley, Oakland, October 2011: \r\n"No one person is guiding it, and it's working. Every little thing is decided by consensus, by direct democracy. What this will look like in a year, what its structures and tactics will be, will be different because of that." \r\n\r\n\r\nThat's anarchy not democracy, Boots, and what it looks like after a year is a whole lot of nothing. Ishmael Reed, an Oakland resident, wrote tellingly of the mess in TROUBLE BESIDE THE BAY. \r\n\r\n\r\nSaul Alinsky, Chicago 1971: \r\n"Any revolutionary change must be preceded by a passive, affirmative, non-challenging attitude toward change among the mass of our people. They must feel so frustrated, so defeated, so lost, so futureless in the prevailing system that they are willing to let go of the past and change the future. This acceptance is the reformation essential to any revolution. To bring on this reformation requires that the organizer work inside the system, among not only the middle class but the 40 per cent of American families – more than seventy million people – whose income range from $5,000 to $10,000 a year. They cannot be dismissed by labeling them blue collar or hard hat. They will not continue to be relatively passive and slightly challenging. If we fail to communicate with them, if we don't encourage them to form alliances with us, they will move to the right. Maybe they will anyway, but let's not let it happen by default." \r\n\r\n\r\nBack then they moved to Nixon and later The Gipper. Tuesday? I say they move, shake, rattle, and roll  to President Hopey Changey. Four more years! Sorry, Alexander.

If you'll notice, on ANY group of comments, some disturbed soul(s) goes around putting thumbs down. How miserable must a person be to feel the need to go around the internet putting thumbs down on perfectly fine comment? Must be some really amazing  folks out there, if that's the best way they can spend their time.

Actually, an abundance of temporary help is a sign your business is fleabag and you are lying to shareholders about it's integrity. I wouldn't invest in anything like that. The management gets preferred shares, so their words are meaningless. Today's lower DOW is a positioning move. No matter who wins Tuesday... YOU lose on Wednesday if you still hold stock. The Great American Cash Out is Monday.

Laurel345..."somethi  ​ ng 'otherworldly' does not want Mitt to win"? Yeah...that must explain Mitt's gain in the polls. LMAO...at this point, I've come to the conclusion that you are good for nothing but a laugh. \r\n echoesofmercy.....th  ​ e number of electoral votes each state has depends on many factors, and while it is possible for a president to lose an election even with the majority of overall votes, the scenario you describe (Obama 90% - Romney 10% and Romney wins) is an IMPOSSIBILITY! Check your facts before spewing nonsense!

Sorry Clumsy... Tshirt = Protected speech. \r\n You are right - the Bible does not have a place in politics - but the Bible teaches morals - and those that follow the Bible (and I do not mean the Sunday only Christians) generally turn out to be very compassionate and moral leaders. So I might lean towards voting for them instead of somebody that just wants to steal your hard earned $$.  \r\n And while there are countless religions out there, most of them believe in a deity that created all this mess. Quite a few of those different religions all refer to the same deity. And the 10 commandments - seem to be a good blueprint for living together peacefully. \r\n As it stands - I think all Politicians and Lawyers are the scum of the earth - a busload of them going off a bridge is a waste of a good bus.

I am not being critical of insurance, especially health insurance.  But, I am being crititcal of insurance as it seems to be in America now.  When you get close to 65, you will get almost daily one, two or more letters offering you the best insurance but you MUST Call today! Then, tomorrow you get more, and so on.  I have started sending back rude letters.  And, when you get the business reply envelopes, they usually go to a different address than the one that sent you the junk.  You also get offers of a reverse mortgage that in my opinion is designed to take your home. I think we need a national healtcare system but nothing like what we have today.  VOTE CONGRESS OUT!!! They allow direct marketing and then you get endless junk mail pressuring you to buy TODAY always AFFORDABLE!

I have no desire to have the actions of the lesbians or the gays shoved down my throat.\r\nIt would be perfectly OK with me, if they went back into the closet. Just because a small minority wish to flaunt their ignorance of the Bible before every one, doesn't mean that these people  are accepted as they would like all of us to believe.  Honestly, the size of these groups are extremely small.  As I  heard recently, "GAY used to mean "happy" --\r\nnow this group has taken over this name to keep from sounding so offensive.  In my humble opinion, these people were once call "queer", a name more appropriate, now if we can just get them to go back into the closet, and not share any more of their personal business --- I don't want to know --- and I will be so happy to not have to listen to this any more.

You have to wonder what happens when someone is trapped in the tunnel(s) between two or more plugs and cannot get out.  I guess they wouldn't drown, but suppose they need medical attention? \r\n\r\nIf the plug's development is not already a high priority, then it should be.  But more money or more personnel working on the project does not necessarily shorten the amount of time needed to finish it.

Obviously he wasn't claiming that the game he cleaned up after was the same degree of destruction as the hurricane.  He was just invoking the spirit of cleaning up after a big mess on a smaller scale.  Attacking little things like this makes the left seem weak.  Romney is a good man, but of course the only things the media picks up on are small meaningless gaffes and awkwardly worded statements.  It's too bad media bias plays such a role in the election. \r\n I've already voted for Romney/Ryan 2012!

It seems to me that no matter how good you are at saving your money, the government will find some way to tax it or punish you for being responsible.  I'm still trying to figure out how many ways we are taxed on the same money we have.  Because of all the money being printed and the low interest rates, we're obviously headed backwards.  It also seems to me that those that know how to work the system for the free bennies are probably the smartest.  I'm working longer and harder for less, and the price of everything is exponentially exploding daily.  Saving big bucks?  I think most people are paddling to stay afloat.

It was entertainment at times. But it was not Country Music. And in trying to make it County Music they are disrespecting the whole genre. If Jason Aldean wants to be a rapper let him go elsewhere. If Faith Hill wants to try to revive a career that never was, let her try somewhere else. I saw her live way back when she was a newcomer and opened for George Strait. She couldn't sing then and she certainly has not improved. Tim McGaw was really off too. Back-up singers had to cover a lot of the notes he missed. Carrie Underwood has a great voice but it seems like everything she sings is just screaming. I understand that Blown Away is her latest hit but due to circumstances, it should have been removed from the show. The music industry as a whole is a hard business. Country Music is and for REAL people and it needs to get back to basics.

Back Off, I hear you, and I so totally agree that 'free cremation' and 'replacement' (as IF that's even possible!) is not nearly enough.  In fact, it's an absolute insult and my heart just breaks for this guy!  (also, truth be told, as a fellow pet loving Tennessean it scares the be-jeezus out of me that this happened so close to home)\r\nHonestly, I don't know what the best solution is... I just know that particular solution is not it, as it will do far more harm than good.

Coffin Butte landfill, north of Corvallis Oregon covers it's "hills" with a geosynthetic clay liner. This keeps the rainwater out and makes it possible to capture methane gasses. This is used to create 5.66 megawatts of power. Coffin Butte Resource Project then turns around and sells this power to local electrical cooperatives. I wish this would catch on in more areas but what Sweden is doing sounds even better.

What is the cost of lives? what is the cost of the quality of life? Don't put a price on such things. Remember:History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.

Unions in and of them selves do serve a purpose. They support worker safety and fair practices. However the complete politicalization of the unions has corrupted the system. Most of the time it's the politicians and union officials that profit but not always the workers.

I am so glad you wrote this. I had a man who had a great job want to marry me, while I was going to a Community college taking a College algebra class, he promised he would tutor me since he works in an engineering field. (he couldnt tutor but Shooo'ed off a  tutor from helping me in the math solutions area) but what was most interesting is his huge amount of insecurity. He told me "HIS life was set" and that I "should marry him",, and then when I was frustrated at the amount of time I needed to get caught up  with Math and also already raising two children from another controlling marriage...by myself and working fourty+ hours a week, his reply to me while struggling to do my homework with out his assistance was "If you cant hack it quit".  I knew from that moment on, a husband to me, would be the one to encourage me to finish/follow my dreams and let me become the best ME i can be. He told me later that he was insecure because he thought if I had a higher paying job than what I had, I wouldnt want to be with him. The education didnt matter at that point. I let him know I could  not and would  not  marry him... although we talk and are friends, I wouldnt think he would be right for "US".

Hell yes I've worn them--if you've ever lived in Minnesota (or anywhere the average winter temp is below zero) you'd understand why!!  And no, the knock-offs DO NOT compare.  I bought a pair last year and my toes were just about frost-bitten from those cheaply made pieces of crap.  Uggs are expensive because they're comfy as hell and keep your toesies dry and warmer than any boot out there while still being cute (yes, I think they're cute... Not the metallic ones though lol!)

From http://en.wikipedia.  ​ org/wiki/Political_p  ​ ositions_of_Mitt_Rom  ​ ney#Gun_ownership\r\n\r\n\r\n"While campaigning to represent Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate in 1994, Romney supported the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales, and a ban on particular semi-automatic rifles.[339] He said at the time, "That's not going to make me the hero of the NRA. I don't line up with the NRA."[340] In 2002, during his campaign for the governorship, Romney said: "We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them. I won't chip away at them; I believe they protect us and provide for our safety."[340]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs governor of Massachusetts, in 2004 Romney signed[341] a measure permanently extending a statewide ban on military-style assault weapons, such as AK-47's and Uzi's.[342] At the bill-signing ceremony Romney said, "Deadly assault weapons have no place in Massachusetts...."\r\n\r\n\r\nGuess he flpped AGAIN!

I'm an embarassed Mn resident in her district.  There are a whole lot of rednecks still livin' up north.  We just redistricted and believe it or not her district is now even MORE conservative.  When I tell my friends where I live, I hang my head in shame!.  Can't for the life of me figure out how she keeps getting elected.  I guess people are just afraid of change and she represents all that the good ole boys feel comfortable with.  It is so sad and so embarassing that she keeps getting elected.  After a year of being publically humilated in her presidential run, you'd think the peopl in the 6th district would get a clue!.  She missed 9-% of the votes in congress while she was running for president!.  And yet, pathetically, we will probably send her back.  Minnesota Nice has just gotta stop. She's an idiot!

Did you know that if you sell your house after 2012 you will pay a 3.8% sales tax on it? That's $3,800 on a $100,000 home, etc. When did this happen? It's in the health care bill and goes into effect in 2013. \r\nWhy 2013? Could it be to come to light AFTER the 2012 elections? So, this is "change you can believe in"? \r\nUnder the new health care bill all real estate transactions will be subject to a 3.8% Sales Tax. \r\nIf you sell a $400,000 home, there will be a $15,200 tax. This bill is set to screw the retiring generation who often downsize their homes. Does this make your November and 2012 vote more important? \r\nOh, you weren't aware this was in the Obamacare bill? Guess what, you aren't alone. \r\nThere are more than a few members of Congress that aren't aware of it either.

As much as I like country music, I was disappointed with the CMA's last night. I like a good bit of the new country or whatever you want to call it, but the old country music that I like even more seems to be gone.  The very thing CMA was built on.  I remember a time when a band couldn't play the Opry if they had drums.  Just ask Willie!!  He and Waylon were banned, thus, the Outlaws were born!!  Where were the George's (Jones and Strait)? Seems too, that several awards were missing from last nights show.  Can't believe I stayed up to watch all of it.  Time wasted.  I was hoping it would get better I guess.

The opposite can apply as well.  I used to work for a company in which I having a degree was rare.  Everyone knew this and people would always try to "one-up" me.  Even their spouses would come around and say "I make 85k a year with only a HS diploma" and all that.  I figured it was their way to substantiate their status.  I didn't really care, I was just focusing on bettering myself. \r\n Now I work in an organization where the minimum is a college degree and none of that angst exists. \r\n You are correct in the arrogance but I think it's more with personality make up than just educational achievement.  I would lean more towards how wealthy their parents were when they were growing up.  Let's just say I never really value life advice from friends that never had to struggle for anything (and I mean anything.)

If you go to the original source, the dog jumped on the delivery person, who didn't want to press charges. However, the dog was a month overdue on it's rabies shot, and as a result there was a mandatory 10 day quarantine by the city. I agree in that if it were my dog and actually attacked someone, I'd be putting it down as well,but that isn't the same as what happened here.

It sucks that you guys categorize all Christians into this pool of ignorance... What if instead of generically criticizing a group of people and calling them names you actually looked into their beliefs?  I understand that there are far too many hypocrites out there who blindly spout random religious beliefs without backing them up, but there are also those of us who actually understand what we believe and can back it up with facts and evidence.

The reason the media likes him is because he is likable.  It is painful for many who cannot identify with him to acknowledge that he is absolutely brilliant and his policies are  primary reason we did not fall into a full depression worse that the great depression after the Bush Administration Spent Trillions and Trillions we did not have on a war we did not need, deregulated the housing market. \r\nThe Bush administration also destroyed our credibility world wide.  That is why people have died needlessly and that is why George Bush has been too ashamed to show his face during this whole campaign.  And God, I wish there was a decent alternative so that if Obama loses I still would not have to lose sleep but Mitt Romney is a complete nightmare, Liberal on Tuesday, Conservative on Wednesday, ignorant and uninformed everyday.  Wake up to the best choice we have!

I totally agree with most of the comments posted. I did enjoy some of the program, but I do have to TOTALLY AGREE this AIN'T COUNTRY. Until we get artists that sing like Reba, George Strait, Conway Twitty, George Jones, etc COUNTRY MUSIC is doomed. We don't need the "yelling" and "screaming", that belongs to rock and pop music. Country Music is songs you can understand when they are sung and touch you heart and soul when it is heard. Taylor Swift for the most part Carrie Underwood are POP SINGERS not COUNTRY at all!!!!!!!!! Please bring back the COUNTRY MUSIC that is trully country.

Thank God Mr. Burns wasn't looking for a candidate that has 23 million Americans unemployed; 47 million on food stamps; 1 in 6 Americans in poverty; has added $6 trillion to the national debt, more than any other sitting president has ever added to the national debt in their first term; $2500 less take home pay, but $2500 additional health care costs per person; billions in stimilus money going to companies that months later filed for bankruptcy; and a President who is running from the truth about what happened to 4 Americans who were murdered in Benghazi.  Cuz if Mr. Burns wanted that type of candidate, he would have endorsed Obama.

But before I bid you adieu for the weekend let me just say this.  I'd bet my bottom dollar that you're not very attractive and or in that good of shape.  Keep in mind that I have never seen you but I can tell just by the way you conduct yourself and your attitude.  Women know that the prettier they are the more valuable they are.  They use their looks to get what they want...  You're just an average chick with a good head and a good heart.  Perhaps if us men put more stock in average than we do in beauty then the world would be a better place.  Oh if it were only that easy...   ;)  Have a wonderful weekend...

Paper work gets mislaid, accidents happen.  I was a volunteer for a dog rescue group for almost five years and all of the shelters I dealt with were staffed with fine and caring people.  I think the shelter handled it the right way, and the only way it could.  Bottom line to it all;  A owned dog needs to be under control especially when strangers are near.  It's a owners responsibility and we made that clear in the "Home visit" prior to adoption.

Another way is to purchase the "GOOD GUY" card. \r\n  \r\nWhat is the "GOOD GUY" card you ask? It is the card the Fraternal Order of Police send to you when you make a donation. When They pull you over you put the card on top of your license. Then the cops klnow you contributed to the FOP and you're considered a "GOOD GUY" and no ticket for you.

I think this is a good idea. Unfortunately I suspect he'll be doing this fairly often, and by doing so it puts it in the forefront of people's mind. You can't really force a person to leave an abuser, but you can make sure there are avenues available to that person who needs to leave. Often the women feel trapped and like they have no other options. By putting a reminder out there to people of what a problem this really is, it will hopefully garner more support for services for victims of domestic violence, and in turn prevent defunding or encourage more donations to the organizations that offer those services.

It's about being tired of having a man that HATES America holding the highest office in the nation. He had no experience, had no intention of gaining real experience and just sits back signing all of these bills that are going to further destroy our economy. ObamaCare is one BIG joke, except that it's not funny. Our Military families are going to end up paying more and they've sacrificed so much already. The list could go on and on of his "Take America Down" Agenda. I just wish the George Soros backed Liberal Media had the professionalism and integrity to actual publish the real stories of what's been going on in the White House instead of covering up for the poor excuse of a Man and President.

Hunter Hayes.  Awesome musician, so-so vocalist.  It's quite obvious he, Taylor Swift and Gary LaVox, lead singer of Rascal Flatts, all have the same vocal coach in Brett Manning.  They have no bottom to their voice and sing with a very nasally tone, with the same phrasing.  They sing in a style taught by Manning and one I hate. LaVox may be the worst live performer I've ever heard.  Unfortunately, if you closed your eyes you couldn't tell if it is Hunter or LaVox singing.  Hunter, I'm from Lafayette, know your parents and remember you as a five year old playing accordion and singing at Mulate's.  Get a different coach!  I know you can sound better.  Don't settle for mediocre.

I think I have had 4 speeding tickets in my life. I have been pulled over 4 times. I always wind up with the ticket, but as this Officer said, I desrved the ticket. I was speeding. I have been known to take a while to pull over, but that is only when I am an area that is narrow and the officer would be pretty much in traffic. I slow way down and signal, and explain to the officer why I took longer to pull over. None of them were every annoyed at that. I am always respectful also. These men and women are out there to keep everyone safe.

Well, I didn't watch the CMA awards this year because they cause me sorrow, anguish and a feeling of wanting to vomit. I used to love Country music and grew up with it. However, that was when it was true to itself and true to its people, the common folk. Country music used to be for all peoples who love all peoples, God and Country. \r\n  \r\nBut, this is no longer true. I call the CMA awards, the Caucasian Music Awards! It is no longer for all peoples, but only for the White, Young and Beautiful, without regard to uniqueness or talent. \r\n  \r\nWe used to love Country music, we the people; Asian, Black, Brown, Red, etc. I will echo the words of Martin Luther King, but slightly modified, "I believe one day the CMA will live up to its own belief, that Country Music is for all peoples, God and Country". \r\n  \r\nUntil then, they can have it. I'd rather listen to real rock n roll, if I am going to listen to it. \r\n  \r\nJesse Gaytan, A lover of true Country.

I like many others spent many a year with a tray in my hand or behind a bar. I have had bad service on many occasions, but I always tip well. I do make it a point to be courteous and speak to the server by name, for the most part the service immediately improves. As for the receipt above, perhaps the patron could have budgeted better and had one less drink or appetizer and taken care of the server properly. The server could be a single mother/father as well, and 2.13 an hr does not pay the bills.

His offer is equally stupid an offensive but since it isnt about Obama people will not complain.  People tell trump "just donate it anyways" but will they do the same to Cuban?  Blows my mind no one ever stops to say "just release your college records anyways".\r\n \r\nWhat could be so bad Obama would not let a charity get 5million dollars?  Its probably something like an anti-american protest he was written up for.  I say we demand to know.  If 5 million dollars wont unseal it, it must be pretty good stuff!

I am not dismissing Ms. Bachmann because she is a woman as that would be discriminatory, I am dismissing her because she is an ignoramus. I'm also going to discriminate against you for the same reason. You've taken the ignorant shortcut and demeaned Ms. Fluke using the same argument that was completely repudiated (look this one up if you have to) by every respected news source around. Ms. Fluke's testimony was for equal access to prescriptions that had never been at issue before. If you had any intelligence you would realize that prescription birth-control does more than protect against pregnancy it is also the primary drug used to manage several other female medical issues. On the flip side these same religious objectors to birth control have no objections to making sure that erectile medications are available for men. So if it is god's will that women have babies then isn't it also god's will the some men should lose the lead in their pencil. Anything less would be discriminatory.

My ex-husband felt the same way. Seems that women pull the "not tonight" routine more often than men though. Regardless, that kind of rejection is devastating to the husband or the wife. All things considered, our son is still the greatest gift we ever received.

The bottom line is that if Uniions were good for the workers and business then all businesses would be Unionized.  Organized crime got whiff of all that 'free' money sloshing around inside the union bank accounts and figured they wanted in on the action....the rest is history.  Graffed, unethical  behavor, failure to do your fuduciary duty to your employer, failure to perform work to your ability, lying about hours worked, dragging out projects in order to get more pay, sabotaging projects...etc.  The list of bad deeds and failures is endless!  I'm certainly not saying this applies to all unon workers, but I don't know of any union working that I know of that hasn't sahred these stories with me.

OK let me ask you a quick question? Our economy has created on average 110,000  jobs per month since Obama took office in Jan 09. This is where he gets his figure of 4.3 million jobs created. But he says he has created 4.3 million jobs since 2010? Did he forget he took office in 09? The reason why he does not say anything about 09-10 is because if you look at the figures we actually have 400,000 fewer jobs than when he took office. Bureau of labor and statistics. Do not look at the unemployment numbers, look at the EMPLOYMENT numbers. These tell the true story. Also how can you move forward when our dollar has lost close to 13% of it's value since he took office (wall street journal) and our debt has skyrocketed by more than 5 trillion, (by December 2012) We have also averaged 1.3 trillion in deficits every year since Obama took office. So the simple math will tell you that it is counterproductive to spend almost 5 trillion dollars to create 4.3 million jobs. What do you think?

A friend is a police officer and he too tells me that if the driver is able to identify the crime that they have committed (i.e. speeding, not stopping fully at a stop sign, illegal turn) then he is less likely to give that person a ticket.  His theory is that if they don't know what they did then they may need a bigger reminder to not do it again.  Thank you for your service and for clearing up the misconceptions that this article perpetuates.

Have you ever been a waitress?  Probably not judging  by your response. But just FYI for next time yes your  waitress was overwhelmed  holidays are the worst . ( oh yeah don't forget she has a  mom too and the  last thing she wants to be doing is waiting  on overprivlaged  bitches   such as your self , but here she is  ) . Your  complaining  on top of everybody else's constant childish ****ing complaining and all of her other duties  combined  doesn't help her  "attitude" as you so  graciously call it. Oh and lets not forget your problem is really more of the kitchen staff's fault not her's but hey its okay blame the over worked waitress.  Then you  complain to her manger which means  she would be facing  disciplinary  action possibly  losing her  job  at  best she'll have  to pay for  your husband's meal,  that  charge  doesn't just go away if you  don't have  to pay for it . Also remember in most states  waitress get half of minimum wage and because they can't   tax her tips   her  wages get a doubly  taxed  which means if your paying attention her wages are next to nothing  she  lives off her tips . On top of which  she s expected to "tip out" or share a percentage of her tips with the  busier, the  bartender, the dishwasher's,  and sometimes the cooks.   Now  because of your  complaints your husband's meal has  just come out of her wages and or tips depending on the restaurant's policy . She's made  next to nothing  on your table. And then you  go and have to split the  ****ing  check . Do you have  any ****ing idea how  goddamn difficult that is ? Remembering who ordered what  and who's  card goes where she probably made a  mistake  on the  tip and  combined them all, but you got her fired anyway because of ten ****ing dollars, not only did you get her fired but you probably  caused  some legal action to be taken  out on her. So now  she's  not only jobless but facing legal action as well  . And then you have the gall to say its probably for then best. Great job you over privileged bitch

Our first wedding was a nightmare thanks to the place we held it. Other than the unexpected glitches, the guests ended up with food poisoning and they had a bikini contest going on outside the reception area - which was made of floor to ceiling windows. 10 years later we learned that wedding was invalid, and decided to get remarried. While hanging decorations, the extension ladder slipped and the wedding was delayed 2 hours due to a trip to the ER. While I drove my parents 2 hours to the airport that Monday, my husband was in surgery getting his thumb screwed back together! Thank goodness the marriage is far better than the ceremonies!!

I'm sure his exact words were reported accurately here. Most of the media is in the tank for Obama so bad it's sickening. They don't even try to hide it anymore. When a news channel has the dishonorable pimp Al Sharpton as a political commentator that is meant to be taken seriously something has gone very very wrong.    Shameful and sickening.

I don't even like her song writing. All her songs are pretty much the same. Feel sorry for the next poor sap who ends up with her, they better hope it works out. I'm convinced that's the only reason she dates now, because when it doesn't work out she has another song or two. Each boyfriend is just her next money ticket, why her songs keep becoming hits is beyond me.

Not a very good point.  The fact is if a dog causes any type of injury and the owner can not show current rabies vaccination then the dog is quarantined for ten days so it can be observed for rabies symptoms.  If no injury occurs and the owner can not provide current rabies vaccination the owner is fined.  If the incident occurs where there is no injury and the owner provides current rabies vaccination then no action is taken in  regards to the vaccination.  Of course other laws could be broken such as leash laws.  I have made my point.

Yeah most of this stuff still requires some investment.  You can't get free movies and tv shows with out already owning a computer/tablet/smar  ​ tphone, and then there's what you pay for the internet access/phone/data service.  \r\n \r\nWith groceries you still have to buy groceries to get the free gas.  Lets say $100 grocery bill, you get $0.10/gal off at your next fill up.  Say your tank is 10 gal, you just saved a whole $1.00.  i know some programs are better than others but you still have to put up the money for the groceries first, usually a significant amount to get the free gas.\r\n \r\nIts just like I try to tell my wife, those Gymboree Gym bucks you got aren't free, you had to buy the clothes to get the bucks and then you have to go back to use the gym bucks and usually you have to spend a certain amount of money to use your "free money".

So - about 3 years ago my perfectly healthy 25 year old husband (not overweight, no diabetes, non smoker) had bicycling accident and broke his femur Memorial Day weekend.  We had health insurance through my employer.  While he was in the hospital he was on blood thinner - apparently blood clots are a common side effect of a broken femur.  When they went to released him days later I was given a prescription for the blood thinner he had in the hospital.  When I went to get it I was told it wasn't covered by my prescription plan - to get it would cost over $1,000. For us at the time recently out of college and just starting out that was A LOT (esp. with all the "covered" medical expenses we were still going to need to pay out of pocket) - so I called and asked the doctor if there was an alternative.  If he needed it I told him I would find a way to pay for it - but if there was an alternative I was all ears.  They said he could take aspirin.  So we went home.  I did some reading up on the side effects and symptoms to look out for (thank goodness) because a few days later when my husband mentioned an ache in his back - and then pain when he breathed I called the doc right away.  Needless to say - one ambulance ride and we were back in the hospital - now with a blood clot in his lung (dangerous but I still thank god it didn't go to his brain or heart).  \r\nThe moral of the story is - an ounce of prevention can not only save lives but a lot of money ($1,000 prescription vs Thousands of $ a day for a week in the hospital with a blood clot in the lung) \r\n\r\nI didn't pay the thousands of $ a day - our insurance did (trust me we had more than fulfilled our $5,000 deductible at that point) but the fact that my husband COULD HAVE DIED because the health insurance vs prescription company didn't see the worth in some prevention.\r\n\r\nI know there are many people against "Obama Care" but for all the yelling about repealing it I haven't heard any other ideas.  There is something seriously wrong with the health care system in our coutry.  I don't know if Obama Care is the answer - but it least it is something - the beginning of a step in the right direction.

Yes, I have seen someone lose it waiting in line. My friends and  I were leaving OCIR and traffic narrowed down to one line. It was taking a long time to get out of the parking lot. I think there was only one exit open. A car came up on the sholder and cut in about 3 cars ahead of us. A person  in the car being cut off pulled out a .45 and shot the driver in the head killing him. To make matters worse the Orange County Sheriff's Deputys would not let drivers flee for safety.

Oh,It doesn't matter how much you respect them or everything you listed to be right and not get a ticket and just a warning. WELLLLLL  your wrong.  It's a money gimmit and all states are hard up for money and the more tickets they give out a day,is more money for the state. It's all a money gimmit!!!!!    anyone going 10 miles over the speed limit should be pulled over.  But 7-9 miles over is stupid and a money gimmit. I have gotten a ticket for going over 9 miles over the speed limit.  He said because I was in  city limits,the speed was 35,I was going 43 and he gave me a ticket.  The small town must been hard up for town money.  So don't give me that crap,maybe you'll get a warning,WELLLLLLLLLL  ​ LL   I have never had a warning and it's always been under 10 miles over the speed limit.  So your FULL of CRAP !!!

Team Romney Admits “Relief” Event Was Staged for Political Reasons \r\nI also found this part of the story fascinating. The Romney campaign admits that the intent behind the rally was swing state election visibility, not hurricane relief: \r\n \r\nBut Boston wasn’t quite ready to lose a full day of swing state visibility with a week left in the race. So, after some deliberation, the campaign decided to use their existing venue in Ohio to stage a makeshift, and nonpartisan, humanitarian project. It would be a way for Romney to show leadership — and get on the local news — without looking craven or opportunistic. \r\nThey weren’t willing to lose a day’s visibility in a swing state, so they came up with the event and crafted it in a way that would still get them political benefit, but would camouflage the intent.  So, as I predicted, Team Romney saw Hurricane Sandy – saw the imminent peril of tens of millions of Americans – as a political "oppotunity" to exploit.

This article makes some good points about planning for retirement, but it's too simplistic -- it doesn't address the fundamental question about PRUDENTLY investing your savings for retirement.  A person can make and save more than enough money for a secure and comfortable retirement, but if he/she doesn't invest that money wisely, then inflation, investment losses, and other unforeseen and unexpected circumstances can easily erode his/her retirement "nest egg."   \r\n I know that many of you bloggers are tired of me harping about Ken Fisher and his financial advisory/money management company, FISHER INVESTMENTS.  No matter, I will continue to do so until every investor is made aware of this egregious and deceitful man and his despicable company! Fisher Investments has destroyed the hopes, dreams, and financial security of many seniors/retirees. I know that many of you have read about my disastrous investing experience with Fisher Investments, so I'll not bore you with it again.  Just remember this:  BE AWARE AND BEWARE of FISHER INVESTMENTS!

The Center for Disease Control has issued a warning about a new virulent strain of this old disease. The disease is called "Gonorrhea Lectim." It pronounced "Gonna re-elect em" and is as terrible as getting Bush-wacked. The disease is contracted through dangerous and high risk behavior involving cranium up the rectum. Many victims contracted the disease in 2008. Most people, after having been infected during the following 8 years, are beginning to realize how destructive this sickness can become!\r\nGonorrhea Lectim is easily cured with a new drug on the market called "Votemout." The first dose should be taken now and the second dose in Nov. 2012. Everyone should be warned not to engage in this type of behavior again; otherwise, it could become permanent and eventually wipe out all life as we know it.\r\nPlease inform all those bright persons you love and really care about.

That was almost as funny as the reality of Mittens and his fake "Hurricane Relief Photo Op" .  The one where the campaign went to WalMart and bought 5000.00 worth of canned goods and handed it out to peope waiting in line to shake Mittens grubby little paws.  They then faked the donations coming from people, and there stood phony liar Mittens smiling and thanking people for giving the canned goods which everyone knows is not what the red cross needs to help people.  Well, everyone also knows that Mittens wants to give the American people NOT what they need but what they don't want!  It is all about him!!  He would have America for HIS thanksgiving feast.  Just like Nixon, the sleeze ball is a crook and a liar

Global warming is a natural phenomenon and has been occurring since the earth was formed. We are but a flea fart in the wind with our adverse contribution to the environment. The only thing that comes out of all the hysteria about Global Warming is making guys like Al Gore filthy rich from those who buy into his crap. Polar caps are melting because the earth is recycling itself and not because of smog emissions. Does anyone ever stop to think (mostly not) that there are volcanoes all around the world including under the polar caps and with their activity of warming the water that is contributing to the caps melting. We may be in for another cataclysmic event in the Earths evolution and yet another ice age that would most definitely effect the existence of mankind. So to answer the above question, "YES" global warming played a part but not because of how we exist today.

people should consume drugs and experience the effects for themselves. learn to think for themselves. then they will know pot is less harmful than booze and all the other drugs similarly classified with pot. nixon was a criminal and a liar; who can believe any reports out of his administration ?\r\nCocaine with social drinking can enhance fellowship between christians when consumed infrequently and in moderation. Heck, a Catholic Pope even praised the benefits of Coca Cola with real cocaine in it. Have your Coke Blessed and then praise the Lord. Now you know why it was called the "real thing" in those coca cola commercials. I say to start a petition to put the "coca" back in the cola. coke and wine are very fine; smoke a little pot just before you dine. I had to give up candle lit dinners with my girlfriend, though. She always used the candle light to cook her smack. After I changed to artificial light, we didn't have any more problems. But then she mixed the smack in the coke and I wondered why I felt so much more good than usual. Gosh, Beave, I really miss that girl.

You are right Doraga, but that was in 2008 when the middle class, and working tax payers voted for him. He had come up with a plan to get people to vote for him. He did not make the economy first priority and now in 2012 he is wanting people to be government dependent and frankly that is where we are going. People do not want to believe that which is their right, but this is at a  point of no return. He has already said that he will borrow again after he is re-elected which will put us further in dept and in return we will come closer to depending on the whole government til if and when somebody comes up with a better solution. Plus it has already been said that no matter who gets elected their would be hard to clean up all this mess.

well I watch nbc news, cnn news, cnbc news and find that for the most part they dont like either, all of the above have shown more of Romney;s ralies than those of Obama's they also let what romney says go pretty much untested as an example relating to ford and gm sending jobs  to china in romney add's. however msnbc is totally for obama as fox is totally for Romney. The only reason republicans are having a hard time with Romney is because he changes his mind on every stance he has taken. so what do you expect the news to say nothing?

April, yes, at one time, I did waitress so I know what they have to put up with at times.So I was ready to give the waitress a break, it was crowded, busy and she was overwhelmed. But there is no excuse for attitude. We were polite and never once confronted her with her out of line remark.  She came to take our orders with a bad attitude. We took our complaint to the manager in hopes he would talk to her before she really lost it and ended up losing her job. I did cut her a break, hence, the tip. But I lost all sympathy when she stole from me. We did not press charges. She is young and stupid. And FYI, I am not an over privileged bitch. I usually tip at 30% for great service. And when I take my family (there are 8 of us), my husband will leave a $60-$80 tip regardless of the amount of the tab.

You can't honestly believe that and if you do you are just making the biased data fit your presumptions. I would love to meet the scientist who can tell me what the average temperature was when the cave men were hunting and gathering. We did go through a period called the Ice age and if I remember things melted. Thank God Al Gore and his cronies were not around because I am sure there would have been mass hysteria.  Don't get me wrong...I completely agree that we need to limit the footprint we leave on the earth in order to live healthy and sustained lives, but I do not agree that biased and unqualified people like Al Gore should be spewing their rhetoric.

290+ obama.  Virginia might turn.  Florida won't.  At this point, Obama can gain ground, but not really lose it. \r\n  \r\nSandy was the October surprise.  Nothing helps a sitting president like a disaster that unifies everyone.  As long as he did a halfway decent job it earns more to him.  Really.. he just didn't have to screw it up.  Chris Christie going on and on about how great he was to work with and how Obama was right there with him for anything he needed undoes a lot of the narrative the GOP had put together.  Especially coming from Christie.. someone moderates trust more than Romney.

You're absolutely right....it should never be based on how much you make, unless you want to included social security into the mix, since it is based on your 35 best income years. Getting more in SS later should actually allow you to save a smaller nest egg, if you're conentrating on getting debt free during your salary years.\r\nThey only assume that if you make more now, you will always tend to spend more...it makes more sense to save more and pay off debt.

The article ends by saying "May stirrup pants and Crocs console them", implying that Crocs is also a fad that came and went.   \r\n In fact, Crocs has revitalized itself with new products and markets, their financials show that they have increased revenues by 50% since 2009 surpassing a billion dollars in sales in 2011.   \r\n Between that and the fact that stirrup pants exited pop culture in the 80s - the author of this article is 0 for 2 at finding a product line that came in and out of fashion in the last decade.

I remember a push for this when I was a child in the late 70s or early 80s.  This was before we actually lost much of our manufacturing.  I guess that allure of cheap goods is the driver of it.  \r\n  \r\nI'm sorry, but I don't have a good answer.  I'm not sure how well tarrifs work, but I'm under the impression that they have a real downside.  I don't that the average American would be willing to pay more for Made in the US label.

Of course the Wages & benefits were upgraded because the company didn't want the Union to pass.  I'd be interested to know how long you'll be kept at this pay scale & when the company will, in turn, account your "benefits" as part of your salary to make you think you make more. . . .

Touche, Soll! Friends of mine recently got engaged and I could not believe how much a ring costs. I know a different couple who got plain old, non-diamond rings, and they split the cost. Both couples are happy, so the ring doesn't have much to do with love, does it? :)\r\n\r\nI agree, it's nice knowing that you can support yourself no matter what happens. My parents raised me to never have to depend on anyone financially (even them), and going to college was part of that equation. Very thankful for them instilling that in me at an early age!

First of all if I were the dogs owner I would be hiring a lawyer. Secondly I would fire the idiot who authroized this paper work. Clearly to busy to read or focus on the job. There is really nothing to do about the pain the ownder feels. We hear too many of these kinds of stories. And, I don't think to err is human to forgive divine--we are not. we hurt and when carelessness hurts and the idea of replacing a beloved pet is like shoving in a widget-it hardly fills the bill. \r\n \r\nFrankly do not know that there is any way to make up for killing the family pet. The family will just have to go through the pain, open their hearts to another animal companion eventually but they can never forget what happened to their beloved Matt-can they. It will alway be with them no matter how much love the new pet gives them. Nothing can erase that. \r\n \r\nSome ritual might help, a tomb stone a place they can go and feel Matt-RIP--

There is a difference between Ugg boots and Ugg Australia boots.  Ugg Australia, is made in CHINA!!  Look at the lable.  Genuine Ugg boots are made in Australia.  Everything made in Australia is very expensive.  I know because my family and I went there a year ago.  The main reason Ugg boots are not selling well is because other shoe companies have copied their style and are selling them for less than half of the cost!  There is NO way I would pay over a hundred dollars for some boots claiming to be Australian, that are made in China.  Another major difference is REAL Ugg boots have Australian sheeps wool lining on the inside, NOT the cheap cotton blend that is in the made in China Ugg Australia boots.  A genuin pair will cost you around $150, Australian, wich is about $160-170 American.  Just an FYI, so next time you look at getting a pair of Ugg boots, know what you are REALY getting!

Well of course the ending will be a bit different then the book. For those who have not read it in a while or at all, in the book, it was a long stand off. That would not come across the screen very well, so as it has shown in the previews already, it appears there will be a battle/action scene that was not in the book. I am very excited to see the final installment, as I fell in love with reading again because of Stephenie Meyers' books, (although I have moved on to more age appropriate books).

Clearly, the idea that Hitler was a Rightist is probably the most successful BIG LIE of the 20th Century. He was to the Right of the Communists but that is all. Nazism was nothing more nor less than a racist form of Leftism (rather extreme Leftism at that) and to label it as "Rightist" or anything else is to deny reality. \r\n\r\n The word "Nazi" is a German abbreviation of the name of Hitler's political party -- the Nazionalsozialistisc  ​ he Deutsche Arbeiter Partei. In English this translates to "The National Socialist German Worker's Party". So Hitler was a socialist and a champion of the workers -- or at least he identified himself as such and campaigned as such. \r\n\r\n There is a great deal of further reading available that extends the points made here about the nature of Nazism and Fascism. There is, for instance, an interesting review by Prof. Antony Flew of The Lost Literature of Socialism by historian George Watson. Excerpt: \r\n\r\n\r\nMany of his findings are astonishing. Perhaps for readers today the most astonishing of all is that "In the European century that began in the 1840s, from Engels' article of 1849 down to the death of Hitler, everyone who advocated genocide called himself a socialist and no conservative, liberal, anarchist or independent did anything of the kind." (The term "genocide" in Watson's usage is not confined to the extermination only of races or of ethnic groups, but embraces also the liquidation of such other complete human categories as "enemies of the people" and "the Kulaks as a class.")

The White man has it hard becuase your ancestors worked very hard to make sure that people of color felt left out of the loop. Now the world is globalizing and revealed to us that the Majority of the planets inhabitants are not white and as Equality and Education take precedence in the work place and not the color of your skin you find that many jobs will have a multitude of creeds and ethnicities entering the work place. The reason for this is the bottom line MONEY. Why hire a man/woman (white, black or other) for 10/hr who can only speak 1 language when i can hire a man/woman who may be able to speak 2 or 3 for that same amount of money, and because she/he  can speak to other people it opens a whole entire new market of people for me to sell to at the same price.\r\n \r\nSo why should any employer take a hit so that YOU. the under-educated canidate can make a few more dollars..... \r\n \r\nThats sounds like enquality to me....\r\n \r\nAnd also mister it's "MY COUNTRY". \r\n \r\nThis land is not your country, The Europeans who INVADED this land never once offered to learn the language of the Indigenous population Before rounding them up and putting them in Concentration Camps oops Im meant Reservations (where they live to this day in some of the worst poverty known today in the United States where they to this day Sleep on dirtwood floors, Where the land they were given was considerd un-livable,farmable and not able to be irragated basically unfit for human life. where they dont recieve federal and state aid like welfare, where the job market is non exsistent.). They did not learn spanish or french before making the Lousana Purchase. They did not learn Inuit before buying alaska from the russian's. They didn't Learn Samoan before Stealing those islands from the Nation of Samoa. The Dutch didn't learn African before Stealing South African land..... \r\n \r\nNo sorry it's The Native American and the Inuit Eskimos who have it the hardest.

Mr Romney did go to paris to preach and give out the mormon wrtings and would never have gone into any military but I dont believe he was a draft dodger

the comment was not about Obummer, it was about the member of the New Black Panther Party standing by the door of a polling place threatening voters who might vote the wrong way.  The justice department will not do anything about it because he was supporting Obummer and was black, the state did not do anything because he was supporting Obummer. So this lady is hassled because she wore a shirt. which nobody would notice if the poll watcher was not a Obummer fan.

God first, your spouse second. Willingness to accept blame even if you don't think it's your fault, not being prideful, spiteful, or belittling, and definitely a lot of compromise. 22 + years.

I don't get stopped often, but when I do I have always been excused by the officer with a warning.  I am always respectful, and yes I know within good reason about how fast I was going.  \r\n  \r\nI was stopped by a state trooper on my way to Vegas, clocked at 91.  I pulled over before the trooper even began rolling away from the median, and was let go with a warning with the implicit understanding that I would patronize some local businesses. haha. \r\n  \r\nIn short, be respectful.  The police have a tough job.  A little common courtsey goes a long way, especially if you have kids in the car - it teaches them to be respectful people, too.  If you get ticketed, you probably deserve it.  If you don't deserve the ticket and the officer is wrong, take it to court.

Pacific Ocean Cooling Atlantic Warming \r\n  \r\nNatural Cycles Reoccurring \r\n\r\n \r\nwww.pnas.org/content  ​ /101/12/4136.abstrac  ​ t    *U.S. Geological Survey, Denver Federal Center, MS 412, Denver, CO 80225; ‡Midwestern Regional Climate Center, Illinois State Water Survey, 2204 Griffith Drive, Champaign, IL 61820; and §U.S. Geological Survey, Desert Laboratory, 1675 West Anklam Road, Tucson, AZ 85745    \r\nEdited by Inez Y. Fung, University of California, Berkeley, CA, and approved January 12, 2004 \r\n\r\n \r\nMore than half (52%) of the spatial and temporal variance in multidecadal drought frequency over the conterminous United States is attributable to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). An additional 22% of the variance in drought frequency is related to a complex spatial pattern of positive and negative trends in drought occurrence possibly related to increasing Northern Hemisphere temperatures or some other unidirectional climate trend. Recent droughts with broad impacts over the conterminous U.S. (1996, 1999–2002) were associated with North Atlantic warming (positive AMO) and northeastern and tropical Pacific cooling (negative PDO). Much of the long-term predictability of drought frequency may reside in the multidecadal behavior of the North Atlantic Ocean. Should the current positive AMO (warm North Atlantic) conditions persist into the upcoming decade, we suggest two possible drought scenarios that resemble the continental-scale patterns of the 1930s (positive PDO) and 1950s (negative PDO) drought.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nwww.stopglobalcoolin  ​ gnow dotcom January 10, 2010 \r\n\r\n \r\nAn excellent analysis article details the natural cycles of both the Atlantic and Pacific Multi-Decadal Oscillations.  The article points to research being done that shows when the ocean currents are in warm phase, the Earth experiences warming.  When they are in cold phase, well, you get the idea. While the rise in CO2 levels may play a part in rising temperatures, it’s a very small part.  Mostly the climate is driven by natural forces. They say the ocean currents could be as much as 50% responsible. \r\nAccording to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado, Arctic summer sea ice has increased by 409,000 square miles, or 26 per cent, since 2007 – and even the most committed global warming activists do not dispute this. \r\nFor example, in 1974, a Time magazine cover story predicted ‘Another Ice Age’, saying: ‘Man may be somewhat responsible – as a result of farming and fuel burning [which is] blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the Earth.’ \r\nCap & Trade and global climate treaties to stop global warming are the wrong approach.  They will cripple already ailing economies and do nothing but redistribute wealth and give power to bureaucrats at the U.N.  It’s hard to know someone’s motives, but it does fit that perhaps that is the real aim.  Not to “save the planet,” (such a lofty sounding goal) but rather to manufacture an issue and use it as a power grab.  Thankfully all of this cold weather is giving a lot of people pause and may help thwart those evil plans.  That is why I am all for global cooling!

Impervious to what Randall rattles about...We had roughly a 0.03-0.04 % gain monetarily today..\r\nOr an overall gain in 4 portfolios...\r\nStrangely the "average gain" in the Indices(markets) was slightly over 1.0 %..\r\nBut we had some issues that "profits were taken" in and a couple others with less then desirable numbers...Dropping us a little compared with other equities that were rising.\r\n \r\nWith large gains yesterday on some positions, I almost expected profit taking today...But all trends are still intact...Exception one that is perplexing and is dropping 2.5% or more after hours tonight or did.  We are still holding that bag, and I have a bone to pick with Crazy over it...CHK...Crazy ?\r\nI am getting discouraged.\r\nRattlin' Randall.....I like that.

You've got it right, polymath.  People don't seem to understand the basics, such as:  Nobody owes you or will give you anything, and you don't deserve what you don't earn.  Don't buy what you can't afford.  Pay off your house.  Avoid debt like the plague.  Drive your car until it drops.  Don't eat out.  Put aside money while you are working.  Live on less than you make.  Learn the difference between wants and needs.  Never, ever try to keep up with the Joneses.  Live where the cost of living is reasonable, even if you have to move.  Teach your kids these basic principles.  Pretty simple, really.

Don't let a false story get in the way of an opportunity to hate.  Unions are the reason we have our labor benefits today.  Companies like Bain Capital and WalMart are the reason jobs are being shipped overseas.  If you've ever worked for an overbearing or corrupt employer or worked in a state like Texas that is hostile to the labor force, you'll appreciate unions.  If not, then just go back to letting Limbaugh tell you how to think.

No.  The water pressure would have shoved them down the line.  Similar devices are used to pressure test sewer lines but those are only tested up to 3 psi.

Rude/poor service. But the term single mom really doesn't mean anything as there (is) a father also who should be providing support, if he doesn't that still doesn't make single mom an OK term as it no matter what implies nothing except she is single.

FactCheck.com says this is a lie (they put it more diplomatically). But the Dems keep repeating it with the cynical idea that the populace is too lazy and stupid to find out for themselves. Maybe they are right, but I'm not voting for people who so blatently have this attitude. (And I'm NOT a Republican!)

Non citizens like you think that way.. That is one of the reasons crime pays these days.. Always crying for more government control and more police.. It is up to citizens to prevent crime and the police are for after a crime has been successfully committed.. Any BS the government says about preventing crime is just to take away more of your freedom.. There are provisions for citizens arrest in some states still.. Many states have repealed this provision when they made defending yourself a crime.. You are supposed to run away if you can, if not leave evidence before you die.. Kind of tough outrunning that bullet you know..

They misused her private property in a manner which is not acceptable to anybody with morals.

Country music has taken a big turn for years, it is more of pop music then country.  Go back the 50's/60's and you'll hear a much different sound of country music then we hear today, not to say that all the country singers are making their music more pop, but that seems to be the direction CM has gone to.

I can't afford a new car but my "new" 2004 Kia Rio Cinco consistently gets about 31 MPG which I'm pleased with since it was rated at 28 city 33 Hwy and I do mostly city driving.  I've had it since February and I estimate it's saved me over $820 since my van got such horrible MPG.  I did my research about the car's reliability and MPG before I bought it and I can't complain.

Hopefully not taught by the far left socialist education/indoctrina  ​ tion we currently have.  These people are all about collecting money from the taxpayers, not about actually EDUCATING people.   The Public option education is about as substandard as you can get.  Even the Obama's don't send their kids to DC schools.   But they insist everyone else do that. \r\n People should demand an END to government indoctrination centers, err schools, so we can educate our kids for the 21st century.

Children in the south do sound strange when they go outside the south.  People in other parts of the country who were taught the Ma'm and Sir routine had at some point a parent of grandparent or other ancestor from the south.\r\n \r\nUsually, a kid from anywhere else is not going to be thought rude for not using these honorifics because they will have an "outside the south" accent.  I have never heard any comments when my kids were visiting the south, they had the "yankee accents" and never said ma'm and sir, and believe me, my kin would have let me know if they found it objectionable.\r\n \r\nSoutherners (I was born way down in the deep, deep south but lived half my life and raised my kids in the Great Lakes area) are still fighting the civil war in lots of ways, and this is one of them.  Drop this archaic and meaningless mannerism and join the rest of the world.  Don't tell your kids to speak like this outside the south..  It actually sounds churlish, not polite, and marks them as hicks.\r\n \r\nThe same parents who would "tan their kids' hides" if they forgot to say sir and ma'm, will use the N word around their kids and allow their kids to do so, as well.  Try THAT outside the south.  I promise you that the N word is still used in most white homes in the south.\r\n \r\nIn fact, some cops up north consider it a sign of having been in prison.  I have lived a lot in both places and am a bit more able to speak from experience than most others here.

Just because an individual has a higher level of education does not especially mean that they are smarter or more advanced.  I know plenty of people who stayed in college and got master's degrees simply because they didn't want to stop going to school: still have parents pay for everything, and not have to grow up and get a real job, stop living the "college life", etc.  Obtaining degrees is not difficult, especially when you are a spoiled rotten student who does not have to work in order to survive to pay bills, rent, etc while attending college.  It is difficult for the people who are required to go to school full time, and work close to full-time hours.   \r\nAlso, perhaps women are smartening up and realizing they need to be sure they will never count on a man for support, thus realizing that college in necessary to do so.  Before I attended college, I researched my degree so I could be sure I could get a good-paying job after college.  It's nice knowing that no matter what happens in my personal life I will ALWAYS be able to support myself.  :)\r\n\r\n(Also - I noticed the "Related: " link within this article)... and I think that is just laughable that it's tied into this article.  In my mind, I find it appalling that the norm of "2 month salary" spent on a ring is considered what men are supposed to do.  My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years, and I told him I couldn't give a rats a** how much he would spend on a ring for me.  It's a stupid stone that is marked up 100% that women just want to show and brag about.

OMG How could they ever deviate from such a AMAZING ENDING. I swear that this right here should be the #1 story in all newspapers worldwide because its so IMPORTANT. Its not like Stephenie Meyer TOTALLY ABUSED the entirety of vampire lore by making them SPARKLE. She should be awarded the OSCAR for the AMAZING ENDING. But if we are going to REWRITE HER WORK anyway why didn't we simple REWRITE THE ENTIRE SERIES so it didn't SUCK.

I guess I am out of style.  I have a pair of light tan suede just mid-calf height Uggs, a pair of dark brown suede almost to the knee Uggs with stitching and faux fur, and a pair of light tan suede almost to the knee Uggs with faux fur and leather laces.  I do also have a cheap $30 pair of suede boots I got from Aeropostale about eight years ago that I wear in the snow when I don't want to get my good Uggs dirty.  I find it very interesting that a lot of teens and young women seem to wear their suede boots only when it's raining or snowing.  I guess they don't mind ruinng a pair of $200 boots.

http://en.wikipedia.  ​ org/wiki/Political_p  ​ ositions_of_Mitt_Rom  ​ ney#Gun_ownership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile campaigning to represent Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate in 1994, Romney supported the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales, and a ban on particular semi-automatic rifles.[339] He said at the time, "That's not going to make me the hero of the NRA. I don't line up with the NRA."[340] In 2002, during his campaign for the governorship, Romney said: "We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them. I won't chip away at them; I believe they protect us and provide for our safety."[340]\r\n\r\nAs governor of Massachusetts, in 2004 Romney signed[341] a measure permanently extending a statewide ban on military-style assault weapons, such as AK-47's and Uzi's.[342] At the bill-signing ceremony Romney said, "Deadly assault weapons have no place in Massachusetts....

Sure, you can get better gas mileage, haul more people, and even get around town easier, but you don't buy a lambrghini or ferrari or even a vette for those reasons..  Might as well start comparing apples to space stations.. brilliant.

I have never owned an iPhone, several iPods over the years but never an iPhone. I did own a crap load of apple stock which made me a crap load of money but I sold it last month when the new iphone 5 was released after seeing how little the iPhone does compared to Android powered devices. I was expecting something earth shattering but all it was was an iPhone 4 with a bigger screen LOL. That is when I figured out apple is out of ideas and it might be time to cash in on those stocks. Need more convincing? Apple's latest "release" the iPad mini, LOL, nobody wants tablets that size, if they do they will buy a Kindle Fire for $179 or a Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 for $199 as opposed to the "starting" price of $329 for the iPod mini which does far less than the Samsung.  \r\n  \r\nApple is history, sorry all you apple zombies, facts are facts.

Glad for the happy ending and the respect accorded the shark. It's been said on many an oceanography program (like Jacques Cousteau) that to fend off a shark, or make it let go, you punch it in the nose. Why? They have very sensitive sniffers, and the nose is the most sensitive part of the shark. Honestly, I'm more concerned Scott heals cleanly after being in ocean water that cruise ships dump wastewater into, all manners of like pee and poo in, and whatever other toxic things enter the mix ... like runoff from Fukushima Nuclear. Scott, yer not allowed to catch MRSA or anything else ugly - one escape is enough, okay?

What they need to bring back on the History Channel ... are shows about History.  Most of their shows anymore are an embarrassment to what the channel used to be.  A little of Pawn Stars is okay - but not 30 times a week.  They have filled the History Channel with stupid junk about weird men doing weird things.  It used to be the first channel I would go to until a couple of years ago. They used to have a lot of great programs - but it appears they have totally ditched the concept of showing anything historical or worthwhile. I have officially given up on this channel.

how do you accidentally euthanize someone? Was someone carrying the needle and then slipped and fell on the dog?  It's not an accident. It's a MISTAKE.  I know shelters have to euthanize for space and I hate it, but I know they have to because of the idiots still breeding and not getting their animals fixed. But, I really wish they took it more seriously. They need to triple check and make sure 100% the dog has to be euthanized.

another great point. Uggs only target a certain region. You don't need them in Hawaii or southern California. You can't wear them in Washington and oregon because it's always raining. They really need to branch out. People aren't going to spend $150 just to watch their boots get destroyed by the rain.

I am so glad you wrote this. I had a man who had a great job want to marry me, while I was going to a Community college taking a College algebra class, he promised he would tutor me since he works in an engineering field. (he couldnt tutor but Shooo'ed off a  tutor from helping me in the math solutions area) but what was most interesting is his huge amount of insecurity. He told me "HIS life was set" and that I "should marry him",, and then when I was frustrated at the amount of time I needed to get caught up  with Math and also already raising two children from another controlling marriage...by myself and working fourty+ hours a week, his reply to me while struggling to do my homework with out his assistance was "If you cant hack it quit".  I knew from that moment on, a husband to me, would be the one to encourage me to finish/follow my dreams and let me become the best ME i can be. He told me later that he was insecure because he thought if I had a higher paying job than what I had, I wouldnt want to be with him. The education didnt matter at that point. I let him know I could  not and would  not  marry him... although we talk and are friends, I wouldnt think he would be right for "US".

The story says it was put out by Republicans??? Where was it put out by Republicans? You people believe EVERYTHING that Barrack and the Dems are telling you!! I agree we should NEVER believe anything that ANYONE tells us or what we read.... Check it out yourselves!!  Just like the lies that we have heard the last 3 plus years!!! I personally have seen unions do weird things... I have seen NON-union people do weird things... it is all a perspective, in how we see it... Good people I am a Republican, I VOTED for Cater, Jimmy was put in a NO win situation. I was not happy with EVERYTHING BUSH JR. did... We have 2 pick between 2 candidates... 1 that has had his chance and 1 that deserves a chance and IF he does NOT do any better then get rid of him!!! PLEASE people do NOT let Barrack fool you! What has he DONE? For the better of our country and give me facts NOT promises..... look at Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Bush 1, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Bush 2 and Obama... seriously, what did each do for the better of AMERICA? open your eyes folks... Vote for the future NOT the past or promises... Do NOT be an arm chair quarterback...and yes, hindsight IS 20/20 so can we learn by our past 3 plus years mistakes? You tell me? Just VOTE!!!!

That's a cop-out.  That's like saying the millions working in non-union jobs, aren't worth their salery!\r\n \r\nFrankly, if the democrats hadn't screwed up the housing market with the CRA, perhaps we wouldn't need to make so much!  The biggest expense in every household is HOUSING!"\r\n \r\nThe democrats championed the CRA in the 80's.  Frankly, it was a good thing; but had unintended consequences.......  As more people qualified for homes, the prices skyrocketed, as a result of the laws of "supply & demand!"\r\n \r\nJust to be able to live, wages had to climb - ask anyone in NYC, Boston, Chicago et-al!\r\n \r\nUnions just take advantage of that 10-fold!!

Yet another classic example of why legislation for increased gun control, besides being completely Unconstitutional, makes absolutely no sense.  Gun control does nothing to limit the amount of guns present in the country, rather it simply takes guns away from everyday, law-abiding citizens, like me and you, and gives them to criminals whose only intention is to commit some sort of crime with it.  Good for you, Mr. Thompson.  --Your neighbors of St. Charles county, MO

So lame! A REAL man realizes the sacrifice she went through having HIS child-If he really loved her truly, he would still find her sexy.  Her body might have changed, but she only became more beautiful as she brought such an angel into the world. I just hope in that one year after him being so immature that he couldn't touch her, that she at least got hers somewhere else!

Ex-Marine myself ( tail end of the Vietnam-era ).....I think I was surprised to discover adults dressed for a Halloween costume contest....when I happened to be out one night back in the mid-80s.   Once I found out about some of the prize $$$$ offered ( depending on the party you choose to attend ).....and being an artist ,  I began 'getting into' the whole thing myself.   I know I've won at least $12,000 plus a 4-day Carnival cruise to Mexico over the years.   57 now, and don't enter every year, but adult Halloween parties are a good excuse to let the hair down.....

No different than a reporter being paid to photograph / broadcast a disaster. We all want to see the disaster. If you have looked at more than one photo or broadcast...you want to see the disaster. If your offended  by the disaster being exploited then boycott the people / firms that broadcast it and advertise on the broadcast networks and other media. This is no different at all. My guess is they are not making money on their photograph. If they are, they're good American capitalist. NO BIG DEAL.

I will say it again.   Those who think union workers make too much money better look at their non union , non secure, low paying jobs.  Did you ever think you are underpaid?  I certainly found out after I left my non union private job of 20 yrs and realized I was being paid 60 k LESS then union workers. Good luck keeping your jobs when you get too old and expensive for them.  You will be out on your asses.  being a good worker does not mean squat.

Milton Hershey would be spinning in his grave!!!!  This is what happens when a private company goes corporate.  Milton Hershey and his wife had no children, no heirs.  Their employees were their family.  They built an entire community for them, sustained them through the depression paying off their mortgages and keeping them from foreclosure.  Every man that returned from WWII had a job,  His community wanted for nothing.  He built a hospital, schools, a college and \r\norphans homes for boys and girls. \r\n  \r\nThis makes me sick.  This is heartbreeaking.  How is it that a bunch a corporate douchebags can \r\nmove completely away from the founder's beliefs and business plan?

I missed the T for Trillion in the previous post.  Obama's administration increased the debt 6 Trillion dollars in under 4 years.  It took the United States over 200 years to reach 5 Trillion in debt, yet your President increased the debt 6 Trillion dollars in under four years. Did you know that we will be unable to pay the interest on the national debt in 2014?     Where do you think we will be as a nation in 2016? (perhaps right where Obama wants us?)     I voted for Romney/Ryan and I am not even a Republican.

When I was in high school many many  years ago, my Dad was strong Union and so was I.  What was said by any union was usually always right.  That was until my Dad (Retail Clerks) went on strike.  \r\n What changed my strong pro union position !    About 7 months before (It has been so long I forgot how long.) the Teamsters went on strike and the Retail Clerks honored the strike and did not cross the picket line, 7 months later the the Retail Clerks went on strike the Teamsters crossed the picket line until the strike was settled. \r\n My attitude now, is that there are Good Unions as well as Good Companies,  Like wise there are bad companies and bad unions.    \r\n The thing that makes the difference is the same in both cases,  the individuals that make up the management  in both the companies and the unions.

Isn't the white house, "our" house, the house of the American people?  If so, why should we not know what is built there?  We know it is deep undergroud.  I would tend to think it is some sort of fortified bunker.  The house was worth 299 million in 2006 amd drppped to 280 million under Obama.  That tells me Geoge, Jr. didn't just almost destroy the nation but did a lot of damage to the white house too.  With George, Jr. ordering the assassination of Hussein and with those assigned the gruesome duty to dig him out of an underground bunker, It seems Obama might think the Iraqi people might think ole George, Jr. was still there.  Hence, the need for a deeper and stronger bunker.  If you love America VOTE ALL INCUMBENTS OUT. put them in unemployment lines!

The minimum wage for servers is based on the assumption that they will receive tips. According to the DoL, the minimum wage for an hourly employee is $7.25. However, the minimum wage for a person in a position that is a tipped position is $2.13 an hour. If people like you choose not to tip, and at the end of the night the server only averaged $4 an hour, no one makes up for that, they're just out of luck for busting their butt to give you a good meal. I hope you enjoyed taking advantage of someone who's probably barely getting by and can't afford to go out to eat, but still served your food with a smile.

Many drivers I've witnessed breaking the law need immediate and severe punishment. It would be better to give patrol officers more discretion and even issue them some non-lethal punishment tools so as to discourage such traffic violations in the future. Just imagine if a motorist knew that upon being stopped for a motor vehicle violation he or she might be zapped with the officer's electrical pulse baton or some other such device to inflict non-lethal, temporary pain. Most people do not enjoy pain. I have seen some drivers that are so aggressive and disrespectful to others on the roadways that it makes me feel like running into them, dragging them out of their vehicles, and beating the living s**t out of them. If the officers in my state and community would be more visible and concentrate more on traffic enforcement maybe these anxious, out of control drivers would slow down and obey the laws. They really freaking aggravate the living s**t out of me. That is all I will say about this and I apologize in advance for any person I may have offended with these statements and my overall tone.

This kind of thing happens all the time in eastern countries, and the woman is much the poorer for it. There is no equality for the woman, and often she is forced to take a step back from her career because of the pride of the man. Hard for me to see it being much different in many households here in the USA.

Zillow is not used by real estate people who are legit.  It is a worthless sight.  As to the White House - it will be worth more after Nov. 6, 2012.\r\n \r\nMaybe the Federal Government can use the White House to borrow debt on.  Some lender might be willing to loan say 125% of the value.

I was a waitresses  when I was  seventeen until i was  about twenty, in order  put myself  through  college  which I entered early  because I finished  high school early .  Most of the  time  I was the  only  waitress on the  floor but despite that  I was very good  at my job .I made a lot of money   in tips  because  I was good  at it.  I  paid for  a portion of my education because   I was good at my job  and  because I worked hard. I have my Associates degree and am about a Semester away from my Bachelor degree. But i remember people like this coming in and making my job harder  for  nothing other than some petty complaint  that wasn't my fault but I took the  brunt of the punishment for it, so I supposed you could say my personal experience colored my earlier response negatively . As to me being ugly ,  low class , and white trash that's  your perspective.  So thank you for that

what if the coach is the one going crazy?  We have a coach that is very verbal to the kids and our school board has let it go on for yrs.  Very seldom are the kids complimented on the things they do right and it is hard as a parent to sit and watch this.  It seems now days it is more important to WIN than have good sportsmanship and fun doing so.  Yes, you can WIN and still have FUN at the same time.  When I was playing my coach was constantly complimenting us and at the same time ENCOURAGING us a long the way.  Very seldom did he raise his voice so the whole gym could hear him.

No, that was the second year of the democratic control of congress.  Both the house and senate went to the dems January 3, 2007 and the slide began.  If you can't figure that out look at the stock market history for the last 10 years.  It shows exactly what time frame this happened in.

Sounds like a bunch of jealous haters to me.  You get what you put in and you obviously haven't put in much, but you expect respect, a typical entitlement generation mentality.  Rude people come from all tax brackets, races, sexes, shapes and sizes.  You just resent people who are better off because you don't have what they have and hate your reality.  It's MUCH easier to categorize people and blame them for your own shortcomings than to work hard to improve yourself.  Hitler did it successfully.

Is Sandy an act of God or others..............  ​ ...and the crazy man by the sea replied, "Our name is Legion, for we are many."  And they begged Jesus not to destroy them and so Jesus let the Demons inhabit the bodies of pigs who then ran into the sea and drowned.  \r\nAs a nation, do we let people drown because they became owned by Demons?  Or do we save the souls who are here by God's will, not the Devil's temptations?  Who are we America?  Money hoarders or warriors for God?  The semantics of faith, divides faith into the faithless.  When we use Christ the King as opposed to Christ the Living God and Lamb and Messenger of God's Will, become demoted that that of Roman, French or English Titles of Entitlement and thus pseudo-honours, then we have failed to do God's will, but rather do man's.  It is time to do God's will.  It is time to save lives no matter the costs...............  ​ ................God will provide the means to the men of true honours wherever they be, and without titles of hypocrisy.  Pay foreward............  ​ ......save those who cannot save themselves!

What I don't understand is why we haven't heard anything bad about Halloween this year? It's been a tradition, it seems, to find needles in apples, some type of poison, and there is always the traditional fires in Detroit. None of this happened this year, unless I missed something. I'm kind of shocked but happy. If anyone knows of bad things happening this year, hit me up with a comment about it. Thank you.

I don't see why they can't stick to the source material, why do they have to change character's races in movies or the comics? There are black characters in comics, and if they don't feel like these characters are good enough, maybe they should come up with some new, original, and better characters. I would like to see a Black Panther, or Luke Cage movie.

Yea but if you just keep changing seat one term Dumbocrat and the next Republick nothing with change. Because both major parties are the same, that is why the hope and change of 08. Really feel like papa bush's 6th term, casue it is. Vote them out try the Libertarin Party, as a former member of one of the above.

Telling Democrats to get out of the way of progress?!?!?!?!? You mean the "party like it's 1899" conservatives are actually in favor of progress? You are either high as a kite, or as dumb as a box of rocks. Do yourself a favor and quit while you're behind.

Yes, I believe labor unions have by and large out-lived their usefulness and role. Big Union is just as corrupt as Big Government and Big Corporation. \r\n  \r\nAnd there is ample evidence to demonstrate the Democratic Party has always kow-towed to the unions.

Republicans love this. They love to support businesses who outsource labor to third world countries.  Instead of paying adults minimum wage here in America, they can force young children to work at gunpoint in other countries. And the diamond trade is even worse than this. Its all about corporate greed and profits.

Interesting to hear a black womens perspective on the scene. I go to metal shows all the time with a black friend. No one has ever made a comment or remark (course we are both 6'2 290 lifters). He always mentions the lack of black people at shows so it is a game where I point out the other black people(can't be the security guys either). If you like the music go!

Something A  Lot Of People Don't Know (I Didn't) Is That If You Are 60 Years Old And Your Spouse Dies ( I Have Lost Two Spouses-One In Car Accident and The Last In July 31 2005 From Cancer. When I Went To Pick Up Her Death Benefit ($255.00) I Was Made Aware Of This By The Agent Assisting Me With The Death Payment. I Was 59 at that Time (September 2005) And Would Turn 60 in November. She Told Me She Had Checked Both Spouses Work Records and That The One That Died In The Car Accident ( Hit Head-On By A Teen Age Drunk Driver on Her Way To Work ) Had Made More Money (Paid In More To S.S.) Than The One That Died From Cancer. Thus She Would Base My Benefits on The One That Had Paid In The Most. When I Turned Sixty I Started Receiving S.S. I Had Retired In 2000 and Was Receiving A Small Pension and Had To Work To Supplement The Pension. With The S.S Check and My Pension I Was Able To Retire Completely. I Received The S.S. Until I Turned Sixty-Two an Started Drawing My Full S.S. Pension. I Told a Friend That Had Lost Her Husband and Applied For This And Received A Nice Check (Back Pay)  Which She Gave To Her Church Youth Group, Which She Financed A Two Week Tour of The Real Holy Land For 22 Children and  5 Chaperones.

Absolutely. This hotel owner has his head in the right place. Too bad for New York that Mayor Bloomberg has his head up his a$$. He should be more worried about the displaced and desperate citizens of his city than hosting a marathon less than a week after a natural disaster. This decision is on par with his brlliant 16 ounce beverage rule to combat obesity. What a delusional prick.

I too live where I can look out my window and see the surf / fishing /diving conditions along the ocean. The view is spectacular, neighbors are great, and there is nothing better than watching that sun rise every morning with that first cup of coffee. HOWEVER- My windstorm & flood insurance are very expensive, and that's on top of my regular home owners insurance. I have metal, roll down shutters that seal up the house but again, they're very expensive. If you want to live on the coast, or near it, you have to invest or buy those things to protect your property & your life. When the  victims of Sandy rebuild, and they will, they should consider all of these important to maintain their lifestyle.  \r\nHere in Florida, we are well seasoned in hurricane preparation and if anyone would like some advice, just ask .

omama did not give a good deal to chrysler like he did GM. \r\nchrysler was ordered to sell..and fiat gave chrysler the best offer; what could they do?? \r\nfiat is creating jobs here. \r\nthe government loan is payed off thanks to fiat. \r\nGM was supposed to sell hummer, opel, saab, (screwed spyker on the deal), pontiac, and saturn...ect. GM would NOT sell anything like they where supposed to do. they (omama) sold half the stocks at half price and now there down while still holding the other half, they would have to get close to 100 dollars for them to come close to breaking even. \r\nomama screwed americans with his GM deal. \r\nthey could have did exactly like ford did with out a bail out. and could have sold GM to fiat or who ever and no american jobs lost. \r\npeople should be very, very, pleased with what fiat/chrysler has accomplished so far! \r\n(no romneys campain staff didn't really lie here. i can see how some people like iacocca and (gates or trump?) could be upset about fiat buying chrysler after there failed agressive hostile take over attempt of chrysler that was the beginning of the cause of chryslers problems. they had to turn to daimler.)

Another American company out of Americans control. It used to be People and Profits then it became only Profits and to hell with workers.

Congratulations, you've fulfilled the "or" part of the statement.  When a party puts together it's platform, it's speaking for all the members, setting a course to say "This is what we stand for."  If the party platform doesn't speak for people standing on it, they need to draw that distinction. \r\n  \r\nI keep talking about the platforms because one of the planks of the GOP's party platform is making abortion illegal in ALL cases.  That means regardless of rape or incest, would need to carry to term. \r\n  \r\n"Faithful to the "self-evident" truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children"

It is incompehensible how anyone could make that analogy. It is also an affront to everyone who is suffering the after-effects of Sandy and those looking at an incoming snow storm.

My experience in NYC was much the same.  Some guests in the hotel we reserved decided to stay another day and there weren't extra rooms available.  We were told that the rule in NYC is that current guests cannot be displaced by new guests even though the new guests have a reservation.  It is not the hotel's choice.  So the hotel put us into another hotel near the airport with cash for cab fare to and from Manhattan until our room was available.\r\n \r\nIf Sandy refugees are giving up their hotel rooms to runners, it is probable that they have other options or don't know or haven't been told the rule.

Could be true, but probably not. Either way, the one thing that is true, is the fact that the livelihoods of those in New Jersey is much better than many other states. The single most reason for this, is the fact that unions are prominent in this area. Those expressing hatred towards a group of organized workers for having better living standards than those who are not organized, can only blame themselves, and the Republican leaders that they elect ( the South especially) Shame On You!!! You'll not destroy my standard of living.

The state of Virginia doesn't care if you're man, woman, or child - if you have an out of state tag especially, you are getting a ticket whether you were speeding or not.  Because of their bull crap I am paying $300 more annually on my insurance.  I wouldn't feel so bad if I had been speeding.  My 11 year old car can't get out of its own way after stopping.  They pulled me over and said I was doing 50 in a 35.  WTH?  I couldn't go 0-50 in 80 yards if I tried.  I did not argue with them but I was going to get the ticket anyway, so why bother?    Such abuse of power!

No I hear ya IR. Deemed. I made the same point when calling out RTP and how he would run under the skirt of Deemed, RT and Popa, but then not have the juevos to keep his posts. Mainly because he then found it hard to play the victim when you have such vile posts. The first three just don't care. They live for the hate.\r\n\r\nHow I see it:\r\nDeemed=Uneducated Bible Thumping Aryan, RT=Angry little man who has lost being on the cusp of being someone, Popa G= Forgotten Drunk who is watching life passing him by and RTP/MP/GG= all the above + so bleeping desperate for human contact he'll say and try to be anything to be noticed.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to see their sub-characters because either they reflect they're believes to a tee or they are over the top opposites that slip every now and then. When people ignore them they fight against themselves. Literally against themselves.

The prices quoted in the article are insane by Texas standards. Many old homes are given away to make room for new construction. With permits & escort the price to move a house a fairly short distance rarely exceeds $15,000.00. Cutting loose the plumbing, HVAC & electrical is something the owner should arrange himself. None of this is a big deal, & can be handled as a service call. Same with hooking back up on the other end.No reason to let the mover arrange that & double or triple what he is charged. If the house is to be set on blocks, it simplifies matters enormously. And I prefer that, as poured foundations are super expensive to repair if settling is an issue. Pier & beam is pretty straightforward and  repairs can be handled by a handy homeowner with a couple of friends & some rental jacks. Like anywhere else, the price of lots varies by huge margins. But $50,000.00 total is not out of the question for an old home on a new lot. 65 to 70 is probably a more reasonable target range for most. You don't want to live in the ghetto.

The ring is like the wedding, both much less important than the marriage itself.  If you MUST have a super-expensive ring, you have set a precedent for the rest of the marriage that superficial things are more important to you than things of real substance.  My wife told me she thought diamonds were boring, and that she wanted a sapphire instead, which saved us a lot of money.  I have always loved her for that.

It all comes down to understanding you vehicle's running. Some you have to have a light foot when accelerating others not so much. Some save more gas at different cruising speeds. It depends on the vehicle and driver.\r\n\r\nPeople who dash from stop light to stop light or stop sign, people who pass a lot of times will get lower gas mileage then us that don't do that.

Mr. Burns' endorsement pitch \r\n  \r\nTop Five Worst Obamacare Taxes Coming in 2013, out of 20 tax increases as part of Obamacare.  \r\nNancy would not let anyone read it until it was voted on. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Medical Device Tax – a $20 billion tax increase: Medical device manufacturers employ 409,000 people in 12,000 plants across the country. Obamacare imposes a new 2.3 percent excise tax on gross sales  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare “Special Needs Kids Tax” – a $13 billion tax increase: The 30-35 million Americans who use a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) at work to pay for their family’s basic medical needs will face a new government cap of $2,500 (currently the accounts are unlimited under federal law, though employers are allowed to set a cap).  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Surtax on Investment Income – a $123 billion tax increase: This is a new, 3.8 percentage point surtax on investment income earned in households making at least $250,000 ($200,000 single).  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare “Haircut” for Medical Itemized Deductions – a $15.2 billion tax increase: Currently, those Americans facing high medical expenses are allowed a deduction to the extent that those expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI). This tax increase imposes a threshold of 10 percent of AGI. By limiting this deduction, Obamacare widens the net of taxable income for the sickest Americans.  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Medicare Payroll Tax Hike -- an $86.8 billion tax increase: The Medicare payroll tax is currently 2.9 percent on all wages and self-employment profits. Under this tax hike, wages and profits exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married couples) will face a 3.8 percent rate instead. This is a direct marginal income tax hike on small business owners, who are liable for self-employment tax in most cases.  \r\n\r\n \r\n23 million out of work. 46.7 million food stamp recipients. Fewer Americans working today than Jan 2008. 16 TRILLION deficit. Obama gotta go!!

@ SuperBeast.........C  ​ learly, the idea that Hitler was a Rightist is probably the most successful BIG LIE of the 20th Century. He was to the Right of the Communists but that is all. Nazism was nothing more nor less than a racist form of Leftism (rather extreme Leftism at that) and to label it as "Rightist" or anything else is to deny reality. \r\n\r\n The word "Nazi" is a German abbreviation of the name of Hitler's political party -- the Nazionalsozialistisc  ​ he Deutsche Arbeiter Partei. In English this translates to "The National Socialist German Worker's Party". So Hitler was a socialist and a champion of the workers -- or at least he identified himself as such and campaigned as such. \r\n\r\n There is a great deal of further reading available that extends the points made here about the nature of Nazism and Fascism. There is, for instance, an interesting review by Prof. Antony Flew of The Lost Literature of Socialism by historian George Watson. Excerpt: \r\n\r\n\r\nMany of his findings are astonishing. Perhaps for readers today the most astonishing of all is that "In the European century that began in the 1840s, from Engels' article of 1849 down to the death of Hitler, everyone who advocated genocide called himself a socialist and no conservative, liberal, anarchist or independent did anything of the kind." (The term "genocide" in Watson's usage is not confined to the extermination only of races or of ethnic groups, but embraces also the liquidation of such other complete human categories as "enemies of the people" and "the Kulaks as a class.")

I'm sure it does. He probably had flashbacks with birthing scenes every time he saw her vagina. It's not his fault, it's just the way some people are. He should definately not be in there again if she has another one. Some things should be left a mystery. Lets face it, it's not an attractive visual. He's not a "jerk husband" msn, he's just being honest. Lay off!

I really like her, but she really killed it with her "I won't let myself go physically now that I'm a mom" thing. Well, I know she is new to the whole mom thing. but moms do not "let themselves go" simply because a child exists in thier home. Mainly it is because they endured the physical brunt of bearing the child, and the full time, no relief from a nanny parenting of a demanding human that restricts to a large degree every single aspect of your life..most notably showering, hair and make up and sleep. Also, all though I do not condone teen pregnancy, the statement made by an adult, grown, rich woman who can not concieve comparing her maturity level and understanding of a young, scared, emotionally and psychologically immature person facing an unplanned pregnancy and responsibility they can neither comprehend nor handle adequately many times is a little ridiculous, also. She should probably keep her comments and focus on what she knows about..and teen pregnancy and overworked moms do not seem to be it.

I think men are turned off by the unnatural process of birth that women go through today, and to be honest, and not to be insulting, I don't blame them in the least. When birth is done right (by this I mean non clinical and intervention free) it gives a man a completely different perspective. I know this from experience.

The percentage to save is also based on what you expect your investments to earn in real terms. Therefore, I think the more relevant questions are: \r\n  \r\n - Where can I save to even get a return after taxes equal to inflation, which doesn’t expose me to ridiculously intolerable risk?  \r\n  \r\n-  Where can I save to simply preserve the purchasing power of my money risk free?  \r\n-  Is that really too much to ask from the financial industry? \r\n  \r\nI know that Fidelity and Vanguard do their best to provide answers to these questions. But, I suspect the true answers today, thanks to the policies and practices of the Fed and Wall street are: nowhere, nowhere, and yes.

Totally agree with Dan - total BS. I have made well over 70k per year for last 15 years. I have never saved less that 11% per year into 401k, and most years 12%. And I am only at $300k, and I know about investing.... Fish story

I don't see any apparent glamorous or glamour in the picks, appearing too old to be a model and choosing a bad backdrop for publicity.  But I guess for them to even get responses on this blog is their 5 minutes of fame.

The govenor should issue an order that any and all professional help will be welcomed and anyone who stands in their way or discourages them will be arrested for interfering with governmental operation (getting the state back on its feet by any legal means possible).  Of course if the union goon squad actually breaks any other laws, book them for those as well butthe unions standing in the way of legitimate help to the victims shows the unions true interests in the victims and the welfare of the community at large.  Personally I wouldn't give you a rats **** for all the unions out there as they are no longer beneficial to anyone except the union leaders and the politicians they purchase.

Friends introduced us.  He started out nice, but became verbally abusive.  When you're 19, you get confused by this and don't realize, the abusive side to his personality is his real personality.  Some people seem to have a Jekyll & Hyde personality.  Watch out for those people.  When I was 19 I thought I could "educate" someone like that, reason with him, say stuff like, 'you know, those words are hurtful," etc.  Doesn't work.  He would promise to change, and would be nice, for a week, then start up with his crazy talk again.  He would drive down the street in his truck chanting, "Kill-kill-kill-kill  ​ ," for instance.  I would say, "Why do you talk that way?  What's wrong with you?"  "Nothin'.  I'm just a normal guy.  I'm a man.  I need to kill.  Men need to kill."  He would talk like that.  When you're 19, you think you can help people like that, you think you can reason with them, "fix them."  You can't fix people who are ike that.  Just get away.  Before it's too late. You can't fix abusive people.  They say the will be better, but don't wait around.

Dictator wannabes and leftists want to lower the voting age as low as they can get the current electorate to go along with, because they provide cheaply purchased votes and are easy to lead around by the nose (due to lack of knowledge and/or experience, and/or an angst toward their parents, and/or inherent short-sightedness).  If you can lower the voting age to 10, an ice cream cone will buy his vote.  It's easy to think you can insist on this, that, and the other thing if you have never had to pay for anything yourself (e.g., a teenager). \r\n  \r\nThis woman is leading Argentina down the same path that took the country to bankruptcy and wide-spread poverty decades ago.  Obama is leading the USA down the same path.  You can't rip off the rich too long before they pack up and head for greener pastures (or at least move their money out of he country).  You can't print trillions of new dollars without eventually devaluing the existing dollars.  This leads to inflation that destroys the middle class (moving them into the poor class) and makes the rich into the filthy rich.  Since the USA is a lot stronger than Argentina, the latter will collapse first and you can get a piece of Argentina at bargain-basement prices yourself at that time if you set aside funds for it before it happens.  It will also be an object lesson on why you shouldn't have voted for Obama (if you do) in 2012, because you'll need to move to Argentina and help rebuild it upon principles of freedom and property rights to avoid the same catastrophe that you'll then be able to see coming upon the US.

I dont  know for sure when they decided that some of the music we heard last night was country, but I guess that is why we have channels that play the oldies but goodies so that we don't forget what it should sound like. I think it was great that Blake received Entertainer of the year. I really could not stomach Taylor winning again when nothing she sings anymore is worth an award.. Miss Reba and Garth Brooks, Goerge Strait and all the ones from that time. But I also miss Loretta, Conway, Tanya, and all the ones from that time also. Thanks for letting us have somewhere to vent.

Well Brutus25, it certainly isn't the out to lunch Romney who does not have a tight handle on what is going on in this country and overseas.  He is the biggest fraud ever to run for President.  He lies on a daily basis.  He has no backbone to stand up to extremists in his own party, refuses to distance himself from the moronic comments made by Mourduck of Indiana, refuses to release his tax returns beyond 2 years, refuses to reveal details about his 5 pt plan for lowering the deficit, turning around the economy and what deductions will be eliminated, would rather start World War III with Iran than negotiate, has no respect for the 47% of Americans, women, a womans right to choose, prefers to rub elbows with the rich, lied about all the auto worker jobs from Jeep going to China, lied about FEMA.  He lacks sincereity and even his smile is forced. \r\n  \r\nRomney is not ready for prime time.  It is now 24 days since he last talked the media and answered questions.  He is an empty suit, lacks backbone, a flip flopper, will say anything for a vote.  Romney wants to over turn Obamacare and yet it was the same plan he rolled out for Massachusetts.  Romney cannot be trusted period.  While at Bain, he was a ruthless corporate raider flipping companies for quick profits while outsourcing and firing thousands of workers.  We all know what corporate greed has done to this country and the working class.  He consulted with other companies how to outsource jobs to China.  He is not a friend of the working class.  The auto workers have filed an "Ethics Charge" against Romney while he was at Bain for a company they had a vested interest, Delphi Electronics that was involved in the auto bailout.  They want to know how much Romney pocketed as a result of the auto bailout?  It's time to push the radical GOP cronies and Romney to the curb.  Obama has the country on the right course and it would be disasturous for this country to turn it back to the failed policies of Bush and Reagan only this time around it will be 1000 times worse.

My youngest daughter at 16 took her savings to buy a pair ($160) about 8 years ago..the next day she regretted it.. I told her its called "buyers remorse" and the boots were made well, were/are very cool and would keep her feet warm in our Michigan winters.  She is now in her 5th year at a state college and still wears them in the snow to classes..Pay more and get quality.\r\n \r\nMaybe Uggs could do what CROCs did and re-invent but styles change and people often overlook quality for cost.

8x is definitely on the low end for the target compared to most other resources on saving and withdrawals from retirement accounts. 10x is probably a lot more accurate, and the more, the better. \r\n\r\n8x is definitely not the minimum, since many people will retire with much less and will find a way to get by. Unfortunately that way of getting by may include going back to work or having to ask for help  from others, neither of which are part of the retirement that most of us dream of.

Country Music is NOT Country Music anymore, its POP, Garth, A. Jackson , Waylon, George Jones, Travis Tritt, Randy Travis, Teri Clark , Reba , They were Country music, this junk being passed off as country, is sickning,  the CMA has turned into a Special Effects flashing lights nightmare, and YES I DID TURN IT OFF

You need to change your screen name to "conjecture lover".  LOL\r\n \r\nI will give it to you that you did hit a nerve... but not in any of the ways you've ASSumed.  What hit the nerve was the fact that I simply questioned... and, yet, you went on the attack as if I'd said these people were the veriest devils.  My "analysis", my "attitude" and so much stuff and nonsense about parental failure... goodness!\r\n \r\nAnyway, I could not be any more proud of the way my sibling turned out... because of me, despite me, whatever, I'll take it because most people don't get anywhere near as lucky!.  So don't worry your little head over my feeling like a failure as a sibling or a parent.  I raised a Marine.  I *know* I did something right.

There is nothing wrong with anyone using an analogy that others can relate to so they might be inspired and encouraged in their efforts to help in a sittuation where it seems their effort is miniscule in comparison to all that needs to be done.   Obviously Mr. Romney knows, and we all know,  that cleaning a football field is no way the same in comparison as the hurricane (duh!) and saying that shows that he has confidence that people would understand his good intentions.

Again with the ignorance Arizona? Really? OK, I'll prove you wrong AGAIN. A recent article here proved that purchasing a new Explorer did not save you money over purchasing the more expensive 4Runner because the 4Runner has a much lower cost of ownership over a four year period. Purchasing the higher quality, more expensive 4Runner actually SAVED you money over purchasing lower quality, cheaper made  Explorer.\r\n@IRN,\r\n  If I tell you your car is boring and bland, that's not an insult? Of course it is. If someone insults you, it is not attacking you in a way? Of course it is. You usually debate reasonably but not this time.

Antagonizer I highly doubt your numbers are correct.  The only way to know the real average MPG your car gets is to fill the tank up all way drive the car and then on your next fill up divide the miles driven by the gallons put back into the tank.  You keep doing that and you will know each tank what your average was.

John,\r\n  If you had bought a rental property or two over the years that you planned to sell to help fund your retirement you would care a lot more about this tax. \r\n \r\n   There is no exclusion for investment property. So if someone (and I'm sure you know some) bought a second home, or a rental, or a forclouser that they wanted to fix up and resale, they will have to pay this tax. Doesn't seem right to change the rules in the middle of the game. \r\n   \r\n   I know a number of people and I'm sure you do too, that worked hard, and made wise investments, so they could have a nice retirement and now are being told the rules have changed.\r\n  \r\n   What are we telling the next generation? Don't plan for the future, don't invest, don't save, the government will just take it anyway. Seems like the wrong message to me.

I bought a 2012 Hyundai Elantra primarily because of the alleged 30 mpg city/40 mpg highway representations.  I have never, EVER achieved even close to those mileage figures.  I have to really nurse it along to manage to get a combined 31 mpg, a FAR cry from the 35mpg I was counting on, since my driving habits include approximately equal amounts of city and highway driving.  When I brought it up to dealer, was told (with genuinely puzzled look) that I was the ONLY ONE who had ever had such poor mileage, and why didn't I try switching to premium gas!  WHAT? Hyundai has lost a formerly strong advocate with that move.

Took the kids up to a house 25 years ago and saw a bunch of pieces of paper all over the front lawn. It was dark and I couldn't make out what they were. Turns out the homeowner was passing out religious tracts, instead of candy, to all the trick-or-treaters. The kids all pulled the paper out of their bags and left them on the front lawn. the homeowners had a nice mess to clean up the next day.

"we wonder if some parents would have been happy not to report this "trick" and simply take the spoils as part of the on candy." Does the BBC have editors? The writer doesn't go off on the guy who hands it out but implies the kids will all do cocaine later on in life and and goes on to attack the innocent victims by writing that he wonders if they would take the drugs and use them? What kind of scumbag writers do they have working for them? I'd fire this ****. He seem like he does it himself by the way this is written. Shame on the BBC and MSN for allowing such a poorly written, accusation filled article.

My receipts never show a tip in the place for it never, we zero it out with a slash and mark already paid. We do not believe in having it put on a card.  We Always hand the tip of 15 percent to 20 percent directly the the one serving us wheather it's five dollors or $40.00 dollars before leaving the table Always, we never ever keep the tip.\r\nOne thing about handing it to the one that serves us is that we know for sure, that it goes to the one it is intended for and seeing that we usually pay more then what's taken out at the register, we allow the one that serves us to do with it as he or she wishes.\r\nWe've seen other servers take others tips from time to time and we just like to see it gets in the proper hands.

Global warming, climate change????? I wonder what the carbon footprint was back when all cooking and heat sources were derived from the cutting down of trees and burning them? Also, survival depended on cattle, horses, goats,sheep,camels, etc for transportation and food. Wake up people this climate change is a load of garbage. Look at real science and history, not the junk science of climate change. We will always have storms, earthquakes and other natural phenomena. We should be good stewards of the earth and not use scare tactics for monetary and political gain.

It was a good show, with not many awards.  That was good.  I don't get why they gave WIllie a giant cheap statue.... that was wierd, kind of broke into the spirit of the thing.  Why did the hostess girl change dresses in between every performance and commercial?  Not that I care, just wondering.  Why was Justin Beiber there singing at the piano?  A real question... is it just my TV at home or is it the way tv produces live music that I hear no words or instruments just kind of up and down noise?  Happens on everything on live tv.  I thought maybe the one girl shouldn't have sang crazy... all that went through peoples heads was how she couldn't come close to competing with either Patsy's voice or WIllies jazzing it up.  Sorry, I do like her band though.  And they do need to bring back a few of yesterdays singers and bands.  Even if they are drifting away, awards shows are also there to reflect on good things.  It was all fun.  I think that Shelton guy has to be the new King, and not sure who the Queen would be.  Swift... French Paris cafe???? Where did that come from???  :-)

Here is the questions you have to answer to determine what you will need: \r\n1)  What will the inflation rate be when I retire? \r\n2)  What will the tax rate be on my retirement income? \r\n3)  What will my health be like?  How much will my medical care costs be? \r\n4)  How much will SS and Medicare really pay when I need it? \r\n5) What will my investment return on my retirement savings be? \r\n6)  How much of my savings will be stolen through hacking, theft, scam artists, etc? \r\n7) How long will I live in retirement? \r\n8)  Will the US government collapse and the dollar be worthless?  (No amount of saving will help you then) \r\n  \r\nI would suggest you can't answer any of those questions accurately. \r\nSo, you'd better save every penny you can.

If this is the best possible job by Obama, he should have been impeached for impersonation of a President. You can thank the ability to hide Obama's background for the hoax of his presidency. He is a communist, just like his Momma, and her parents were communists. Obama's in-laws sent their little daughter to n admitted communist school on Mercer Island in Seattle to learn the marxist way.

I see a lot of comments on here I would be afraid to make.  One thing I know for sure is when I look into the nighttime sky, I see things no man put there.  Man cannot keep cars off each other.  If man controlled the planets, can you imagine the collissions???  The Sun has never burned out in my lifetime and I heard my parents talk of it being there when they were little.  Something accounts for teh seasons, the grass growing and wilting away. Something is in our bodies that allow us to walk and talk but when we die, that something will be gone. I don't have faith in man, government nor nations.  In fact, I ask everyone to VOTE AGAINS ALL INCUMBENTS for a more responsible government, but I will not say some of the things I see on here.  The Bible says every tongue will confess and every knee will bow, or something similar to that.  I'll confess and bow now!

I agree that the shirt doesn't outright say which party to vote for... but, do you really think most people don't know exactly which party she meant?\r\n \r\nAnyway, you basically negated your own comment with the last sentence... separation of church and state provides an even greater argument against this woman wearing that shirt to a polling place than simple electioneering does.  So, I'm glad you mentioned it.

Over 50% of all first marriages end in divorce, high rate with second marriages and even higer with teen marriages.  I never felt marriage a good idea, but I've now been married for almost 30 years.  She's great, I'm lucky.  Compromise, trust, patience, trust, honestly (many things already listed), not marrying until one is ready, daily chats and walks help, time alone helps.  I guess there are many components to a good marriage.

Obviously you are oblivious to the facts and have no idea what the truth is.  Exactly where did you acquire your stats on welfare that there are more whites on welfare than blacks?  If ignorance was bliss you would be a shinning star to us all.  Maybe if you did a little research you might see there was no raciest comment just the truth, live with it.  You think just because someone uses the word Black could have just as easy used the N word, that automatically means you are a raciest no wonder America is going down the hole, I'll bet you are even going to vote for Obama.  No self respecting American that has any love for this country would dare vote to continue this promoter of welfare and unions.  If you grew up in the projects then you of all people should know just how destructive WELFARE is on a country,   Because a Black here in Clark county believed that because he was black the Government Owed him free electricity.  When the WHITE Utility worker came to cut off the power and even tried to help him with time to get money when the White utility worker came back the BLACK man and his Black Wife and Black 14 year old Son, in cold blood ambushed the White Man shot him in the back of the head, MURDERED the WHITE utility worker because of WELFARE.  But because this was a Black Man Killing a White Man the National News media did not even publish a single word of this.  Had this been a White killing a Black, every Black **** like the reverend Jessie Jackson and Al big mouth Sharpton would have been here raising pure hell.  So take your reversed Raciest **** out of my face and get a life outside the Projects and maybe you will find out what is's like to live in the REAL WORLD.   Oh one other thing Mississippi Blacks are so proud to be from Mississippi, that thanks to our state loving Black community of over 55% of the population we got to keep our flag, the one with the Rebel flag on it , the one all you Yankees wanted to take away because it was raciest,  well we here in Mississippi are a hell of a lot more proud than you ever will be of where ever you came from.  At least Mississippi's blacks know the difference between racism and ignorance.

I agree totally..It's not only depressing but scary how easily brainwashed people can be and how they don't have the sense enough to do independent research on their candidate or maybe their just lazy!.I personally supported Ron Paul and was actually planning on writing him in until I researched Romney and listened to some of his speeches. I realized he's a completely out of touch,arrogant,lying  ​  rich snob who has absolutely no knowledge whatsoever about foreign policy!!.Therefore I feel I have no other choice but to vote for Obama.So for you Mutt lovers,when your lying, hypocritical,arrogan  ​ t rich boy doesn't make it to the White House you've got no one to blame but Mutt himself..It'll truly be a pleasure to see him get kicked down off that pedistal he thinks he's on.

Lighten up "little mama" and live, love, laugh out loud! \r\n \r\nPS: You need to lighten up too there John Doe, hiding behind your anonymous name, behind your anonymous keyboard, casting insults to those with an opinion.

Luminex and Affymetrix do not even do sequencing! Luminex makes immunoassays and Affymetrix makes gene arrays. Maybe to the layperson like yourself, all these technical sounding words mean the same thing, but they are not even similar technologies. Why would Roche want to buy Affymetrix for their array business? Roche already has its own array business with Nimblegen. Clearly you haven't done any research at all and you're just some idiot analyst spewing trash for a quick buck.

Say No is absolutely right, as is MC and others. Lawsuits are the only way to get wide-scale changes (remember the Ford Pinto as the first classic example). \r\n  \r\nAnd, for the naysayers, you are not educated enough to know a lot of lawyers went to law school with dreams of doing good. The realities of having to earn a living come into play but these lawyers still do whatever they can, maybe knocking off early and driving their Corollas down to a battered women's shelter to offer legal help.  \r\n  \r\nYes, there are lots of scum in any field, but you hear about bad lawyers more than any other field but don't see what the good ones do, esp since lawyers are obligated to keep it down.

For boots intended to keep your feet warm, they are pretty useless against the elements.  If it rains or snows you can't wear them or you'll ruin them and freeze off your toes.  Plus they are way too expensive.

I have said over and over again - I look at young couples now and wonder what she sees in him. The women are educated, they work, they keep up the house, they take care of the kids, they cook and the husband watches some sort of sports all week and plays god. \r\nWish I was younger to see how this all plays out for the next generation. If it were me....I'd dump em. Sorry to say, men brought this on themselves. Who needs them?

People, Wake up!  We, along with most of the rest of the world, operate under a debt monetary system. Under this system, no money is allowed to be created, unless we borrow it from private commercial banks.  Government borrows from the fed or other countries by selling treasury bills, notes or bonds.  We do not have enough money to pay that debt, so we just pay the interest on it.\r\nWhen corporate America borrows, we the public pay those loans, plus interest, in the higher cost of living, when businesses raise the price of their products or services.\r\n \r\nThink about it!  Money has to have an origin.  You didn't always have money, and neither did your boss.  It had to begin somewhere.  Where do you have to go to get any sizeable amount of money?  The bank!  All money in circulation, had to be borrowed and then spent into circulation.  When you get your paycheck, you are being paid from the principal of someone's loan that the company you work for has captured through commerce.  If you have money in an IRA, 401K, bonds, stock, a pension plan, checking account, savings or just in your wallet,  you could not possibly have that money unless someone else either individually or collectively has an equal amount of indebtedness.\r\nTher is a difference between wealth and money.  You cannot spend wealth until you convert it into money.  That can only be done in one of two ways.  You must either sell some of your wealth to someone for some debt dollars, or you would have to borrow against your wealth.  Either way, the bankers some how are involoved.\r\n \r\nWhen you go to a bank for a loan, you must sign a loan agreement, mortgaging a portion of your future productivity! The bank then credits your checking account with the principal amount of the loan.  The banker is creating that money out of thin air, with the touch of a computer key.  Under fractional banking, bankers can create a multiple of what they have in reserves.  Usually about 9 times.  But who is really creating the money?  Isn't the banker actually creating the money to loan to you, on your promise to pay it back?  So maybe it is the borrower who is actually creating the money and the banker is only the middle man, who sits back and collects the interest that no money was ever created to pay!!!\r\n \r\nWhen no monay is created to pay the interest on any loan, we are always creating a debt greater than the debt principal of every loan.  Blame the federal reserve and this ponzi system for our evergrowing indebtedness.\r\n \r\nCongress gave the federal reserve and it's bankers the power to create money to loan to us, so why can't congress give the power to create money to the treasury, to pay for all of our infrastructure needs, without borrowing.  This would solve our unemployment problems, take people off welfare, reduce the need for fuel and road use taxes, just to name a couple benefits.  \r\n \r\nPeople, keep in mind that when we have to borrow in order to have a medium of exchange, that money has to be paid back and erased off the books, (or it is uncreated).  When money is earned first, then spent into circulation, it doesn't have to be paid back to anyone, and lives on indefinitely.\r\n \r\nSome people claim that creating money this way would create inflation.  I highly doubt that, since no money would enter circulation until it was matched with productivity.  Our current monetary system was broken before it even started.  We need change

This year's X-Factor is worse than the last, and will unlikely see another season.  Again, the judges can't even be respectful toward each other, which Simon make think makes for dramatic TV, but it is just nauseating.  Speaking of Gagging, Khloe is the absolute worst MC in the history of television.  It's like watching a Japanese game show.  She is stilted, unnatural, robotic, annoying, rude and totally without talent.  Watching her and Mario at work is like observing the machinations of a kindergarten P.T.A. production.  While I would have expected him to have been good in this role, frankly, he's not much better than Khloe.  I've also been disappointed with the level of  talent.  It simply can't compare  to The Voice.  I'm giving this circus another 2 weeks, and if they don't make some personnel changes, and get their act together, I will be watching something else.

Your definition of a REAL man sounds like a woman.  Expecting a man to over ride millions of years of evolutionary programming because pumpkin refuses to lose the weight is pretty much delusional.  How about expecting a woman to find the same guy attractive after he stops being affectionate and romantic?  \r\n \r\nThats right.  Men's needs are wrong and women's needs are noble.  Only in America.

We are our brothers' keeper.  When we knowingly participate in the use, sale, or investment in companies which enslave children, we are helping to support the practice.  If it doesn't bother you to think of children being forced at gunpoint to work for the profits of others, then I fear that you should give up your claim of being a human being.  You more closely resemble a rock, devoid of character or decency or compassion.\r\nThe parents you hold accountable probably have no access to birth control (I'm sure that makes Ryan and Romney happy) and no access to education or jobs.  They don't have choices in life.

well as it turns out she was not pregnant it was part of the costume but i still stand by my comment on what should happen to women who are pregnant and drinking or using drugs ! if you are going to bring a child into the world then you cannot start with screwing it up physically and  mentally before it is born ! and any one caught doing that should be charged with child endangerment and either put in rehab or drug and alcohol tested until the birth and then monitored after to ensure the safety of that child!

During the Industrial Revolution we needed unions to overcome unjust, unequal, and unregulated labor practices.  With that said, Unions are now one of the biggest problems we have in America.  Too much power in the hands of those with NO sense of responsibility to community is crazy.  In a time of Disaster 'one nation' needs to pull together.  If the IBEW is indeed rejecting the assistance of Non-union electrical workers, from other areas of the country, it is disgraceful.  Time to end the 'nice-guy' relationship between the Union's and the current administration that supports them.  If this is what comes from years of 'special' treatment with the Union's it’s time to change.  The citizens of our country deserve the best from those who are offering to help them in a time of need.  Obummer’s administration needs to stand-up and take the Union’s on, and file criminal charges against those who intimidate those non-union trades that are responding.

If I could just play devils advocate here. None of you guys know the circumstances. \r\nMaybe it was her kids birthday and all they wanted was to go out to eat with his/hers friends from school. \r\nMaybe that single mom had enough money just for the dinner and ice cream or dessert somewhere else when they left. If they tipped they wouldn't have enough for dessert.\r\n\r\nThat waiter or waitress probably collected tips from 20 tables that night. \r\nThey will get over it and im sure every shift somebody leaves more than the recommended percentage. So that will make up for it.\r\nLeave single parents the F%$Ck alone !

Living in South Florida we are used to the madness after the storm passes. At first everyone is nice, caring and worried even about strangers they meet right afterwards.But then after a few days people are pushing and shoving and cursing each other out...not everyone but a lot do... It get worse as time goes on. I pray that things get back to normal as quickly as possible, Be patient, be courtesous and keep a sense of humor!

It is well known that the Republican party in general loves to throw religion in your face.  I think the point was that the average American would see this as a pro-Republican shirt.  Just because it doesn't directly state it doesn't mean that it wasn't implied.  And yes, I do realize that not all Republicans follow the Bible and many Democrats do.  That is not the point.

Among women with comparable risk factors, planned home birth had two or three times higher the risk of neonatal mortality, (depending on which study one reads.) \r\n My inner earth goddess believes parents should make choices that work for them and please themselves in birthing options. \r\n But, no way childbirth is less dangerous simply because I too support women who choose midwifery.

Man, I was trying to be nice with an earlier comment I made.  That was all a bunch of crap.  Didn't there used to be a separate class of music called Country Fried Rock, or Pop goes the Country or something?  What happened to that?  $30000 and 30 miles does not make a biker, and a fake southern twang accent does not make country.  That underwood girl may look nice and all, but all she does is scream like a pig farmer... higher note... scream louder... lower note... scream less, but scream.  And every one of them looked the same in their baseball caps.  Every band sounded the same.  It is all pop... just like that freaky dude with the sunglasses said "They wouldn't take me in rock because I wasn't rock enough... thanks country for letting me in".  Swift singing some Paris Cafe yuk up song at the CMA was just about the bottom.  And motorboatin might be funny to listen to half tanked at a party... but as super special song of the year?  People used to like country because it had its own beat, you could hear the words, and songs had meaning either happy or sad, and they were about real life.  Crapped out last night.

Truthfully, I don't know how I feel about that. If veterinarians are forced to raise their prices to inconceivable amounts to cover liability insurance, then many owners will not take their pets to the vet for routine care. Even animal shelters could lose dramatically on this. Their liability insurance would sky rocket, which means that the amount of money that they have to take in more animals will drop signficantly.  Less animals will ever make it to a shelter. And working in this field, I have heard more than a few owners say that they will just take the dog out in the backyard and shoot it. One threatened to run over his own dog if HS couldn't take it. (We took care of the situation!)\r\n \r\n A few may win big, but the vast majority could lose dramatically. This isn't an easy issue. If it were, all 50 states would have passed the law already. I would like to think that people are thinking about the best interests of pets and not the best interests of  pet owners.

Budweiser's management might make a few more bucks in a financial quarter by using cheaper hops, thinner bottles, and brewing beer out of rice mill floor sweepings, but they will be  going the way of every other formerly great company that trashed its brand value and market share by dumping  a lower quality product onto knowledgeable and once-loyal consumers and then blaming their marketing department because expensive advertising didn't get people to keep on buying the product. A consumer doesn't have to be a  genius-level golden-tastebud connoisseur to confidently determine the differences between crummy, OK, and really good beer, and there is a whole lot of beers available for about the same price as Bud.

I was a cop for 25 years.  I worked traffic and  patrol and finished up in upper management.  I wish I could summarize the ticket /warning debate but it isn't that simple.  Quotas, in my experience do exist, but not in every dept, or every shift or every squad.  I was never much of a ticket writer but it didn't hurt me.   Besides, even a quota ticket doesn't mean a ticket isn't warranted.  It just means the dept wants their people spending more time enforcing speed limits.   If i was to make any generalization at all, I would say most cops set a speed at which they normally write a ticket and stick to it.  Lane changing, running a red light, following too close are taken more on a case by case basis.  Also, seasoned, rational cops aren't rattled by the average citizen being upset over a ticket.  But unless you are sure you are dealing with one of them, I would suggest being respectful and non argumentive.  I also agree with going to court but no guarantees. Although not common,  I have seen judges giving thieves, bad check writer and drug users probation, and the next day in traffic court they are zapping routine traffic violators.

Having a baby is in no way a sacrifice, it is a blessing and an amazing experience when it's done naturally and without clinical intervention. Sure a man should have respect for our ability, but why should a man respect a woman who allows herself, and in turn her child to be pumped full of drugs? On the other hand uneducated and preyed upon by money hungry doctors who love the revenue they get from slicing women open for 'emergency' c-sections.

It won't be long and they will be dealt with. Sadly you won't be able to see them being hauled in unless it turns out you're called in to testify.

I'm a scuba diver and not just in diver training, but in many shows I've seen on TV you're told the best way to discourage a shark is to punch it in the nose.  It's very sensitive.  So I don't know if it's a novel idea, just smart!  \r\n \r\nGood work, Scott, for keeping your cool and living to tell about it!

There is another word for officer discretion. It is officer prejudice. If am am traveling 10 miles per hour over the speed limit and you are traveling 10 miles per hour and we each get pulled over and one of us gets a ticket and the other doesn't, there is something grossly wrong with our criminal justice system. Maybe I was more black than you, maybe you were more female and attractive, maybe you attend the same church as the officer, or maybe the officer and I are each Redskin fans, or maybe if you and I have each exhibited the same behavior, perhaps we should each receive the same consequences. Police prejudice in many forms exists across this nation (see stop and frisk in New York City as just one example). When an officer contacts dispatch and informs dispatch that he or she is making a stop for a traffic violation, the decision should be made then. You have either violated a law or you haven't, who you are, how you act, or how you communicate with an officer should have nothing to do with a decision to issue you a ticket. Should we do the same thing with murder. Yeah, she killed her children, but she sure was nice and attractive when the police contacted her to investigate the situation. It's prejudice and should be seen as the misconduct which it is, plain and simple.

Totally agree with Rancic!  Good for her for voicing her view.  As a mother who also struggled with infertility, it is very disheartening to see all these teens who do not understand what an amazing miracle it is to have a child.  When you are struggling and attempting every possible treatment to have your own child you begin to feel jealous and envious of those who are able to conceive so easily, especially those who take it for granted.

"Starting in 2014, the federal government will require you to have health insurance. That's when the individual mandate goes into effect under the Affordable Care Act." \r\n  \r\nSo those who can't afford it now at any cost are required to buy it or pay a fine and go further in debt? Hey Obama, how is this going to help these folks? Maybe you could just pass a law saying no one can be poor anymore and problem solved. \r\n  \r\nIf you think you will get affordable health care, then think agian. The switch and bait rates are now in affect for a few, but after everyone is locked in, the rates will rise as insurance companies are already asking for rate hikes. You who have your company paying most of your costs, will soon have your plans dropped, thus you will pay 100% of the costs. Not cheaper.   \r\n  \r\nGovernment run health care will never be cheaper, better quality, nor more efficient. Don't think so? All I can say is DMV, TAS, IRS, FEMA, INS, Welfare...etc.

Its funny that it mentions kids...  You know what?  I waited 17 years in my marriage to have kids and it still is tough 10 years later because you cannot account for the variables they add to your life.  Let alone the variables that life throws at you otherwise.  I have a two sets of friends that have skated through life without job loss, or any other significant "X" factor that you cannot account for in your life... One set does not have kids and do not intend to have kids.  I am happy for them for their good luck.  Credit cards almost become a necessity in many ways as a result of having kids and just overall life situations.  You cannot control those things.

It's a statement to society and seems cool at the time to look as pale as you can with jet black hair and sing words about death and blasphemy God.

You raise a valid point: Since we don't know how you drive, where you drive, whether or not you have the A/C compressor operating, what your tire pressures are, if you ride your brakes, etc., etc., we will never know how to evaluate individual cases. I noticed my fuel mileage suffering dramatically after my 17 year-old got his first car. I thought, with him driving my car less, that I would get better mileage; then I caught him syphoning gas from my car. Hmmm.

You are right! I always say it is not what you make it is what you keep. I retired 2 years ago on a small pension and my savings. This was only possible because I have 0 debt and have been that way for 5 years prior to retirement. I will be eligible for SS next September then I will be able to save a little and up my fun budget. I feel fortunate to be able to do this but I did set this path 40 years ago. In a nut shell, debt is the big key in my opinion

I have been avoiding Hershey products since they put Americans out of jobs and moved their operations to China.    I would like to say that with this latest news I will actively campaign that none of my friends, family, acquaintances buy Hershey products, but the question remains what will be the impact on those depending on the forced labor?

Hersey's was founded by John Snavely Hershey, a Mennonite. Mennonites are known for involvement with social concerns, and Hershey - who helped many -  would have been appalled if a child labor connection proved true. I seem to recall years ago, during the Three Mile Island meltdown, that Hershey's assured customers that their chocolate was safe. Much of the milk used in making it came from dairy farms around that nuclear plant, and cows are known to absorb radioactive matter into their milk extremely well. Corporate spin for the almighty dollar. Nothing new.

I been pulled over 7 times in my 15 years of driving. Four resulted in warnings and three resulted in tickets. I believe if you are pleasant and honest and have a clean driving record that will reduce your chances of getting a ticket. It can also depend on the mood of the officer and if theyre looking to increase revenue, on the occasions that I did receive a ticket I tried to play the honest and pleasant role but the officers seemed to have been parked/hiding on the side looking to ticket someone.

A 'hickey".  Small town Iowa in the mid-50's.  I was about 9, perhaps 10 years old.  My older brother, and a friend of his and I went to a house where a teenage girl lived.  Her parents were gone at the time and she had 2 of her friends with her.  They said they had no candy, but would give me a hickey.  Not knowing what it was, I figured 'what the heck", I'll take it if they have no treats.  The girl who lived there convinced me to stand there, saying I'd like what she was going to do.  Honestly I didn't feel much at all, just the mild feel of her at my neck.  She stood back after a few seconds and laughed.  No one told me about it until we'd left & my brother & his pal were laughing.  They told me what had happened & I was so embarrassed that when we got home and my mother asked me what it was, I told her I was running and ran into the crossbar on a clothes line.  She told me I should be more careful.  <shaking my head>

Unfortunately, most of the people who demonize unions have little knowledge of the history of labor relations in this country.  Lack of education, resulting in lousy job prospects, combined with an unrelenting right-wing business campaign against unions on talk radio and Fox News, results in jealousy and hatred of people who belong to unions.  The result is people blaming unions for business conditions that are the result of corporate greed, as demonstrated by the outsourcing of work overseas, while executive pay has gone through the roof.

Modern (at that time, even) country had gotten so bad that Johnny Cash started recording something else (I don't know how you'd classify it; folk maybe). 'Course ol' JR was always more of a "rockabilly" kid; not a whole lot of fiddle or steel in his music (good music just the same. I'm not knocking it). We still have Merle Haggard, Ray Price, and Willie Nelson, but you don't see any of them making much of a ripple in the waters of "corporate country" radio. The only thing that will turn this industry around is if people quit buying this mass-marketed cookie cutter garbage, or if enough people START buying traditional country music product. The business follows the money!

Students should be *allowed* to hug, certainly, although everyone must  learn to avoid the jerks who actually attempt to inflict injury instead of express affection.  They are the ones who need discipline.  There are other potential social issues, but simply forbidding hugs does not teach anyone anything with respect to resolving them.

Unions in the 60's and 70's were good for the worker. They protected your seniority, pay scale and most of all your safety at work. And yes they do a better job than non-union workers. Today it seem like the only thing the union wants is your money.  I'm glad they turned the workers away but then again, when in a "State of Emergency" I would work beside a non union employer. Just to get the power back on for the citizens of NJ.

There is such a thing as climate change on the earth. It has happened before, it will happen again. Calling it "man made" is the issue. I, personally , do not believe it is "man made". We have had something like 5 ice ages on earth. I do not think there were any cars during any of them. We know that the oceans have been at many levels during the worlds history. I don't think fossil fuels were the issue then. I believe getting"research funding" has more to do with "scientific opinions" than anything else. Give us data about the earths orbit around the sun, the varying wobble of the earth, solar activity,etc. There is a more complete picture out there.  \r\n It does not mean we should not be good stewards of the earth, but maybe we need more and honest data not influenced by "funding".

I've had family members who have worked as either servers or bartenders, and knowing that servers get less then half of minimum wage opened my eyes to their plight. Anyone who cannot afford to pay gratuity should stay home and eat noodles.\r\n I mean, gee whizz! \r\nOn the other hand I have eaten out (and I like to eat well) and have given the server cash in hand as a tip, then put a small sum for a tip on the receipt. \r\nI tip very well for good service and just adequate for sorry service. I NEVER not tip.\r\nIf I can afford to eat out I have to figure in gratuity before I go. \r\nIf you feel you don't have to tip, then you should eat at fast-food places because they get paid at least minimum wages.

I think Punish is too harsh a term.  We are considering that these rates - while seeming to be punitive - are an incentive to keep the economy from tanking once again.  I believe its working.  But we do Need More- By removing the Useless fronts for the ultra right wing of the R Party (AKA Tea Partiers) we can immediately move fiscal policy to the forefront again.  Anything, after 2 years of Nothing, will have the effect of motivating money again, even tax policy.  \r\n\r\nIf you are sincere about not enjoying monetary policy and central bank 'control', we must act together to re-elect people of either side willing to work together again as well, and thus, reignite the working fires of the legislative burners.

The problem really is the poor children.  Facts are typically  that their families cannot manage without their help, and that no one is addressing how to help the families manage without sending 6 year olds  into the workplace.  Very sad and very wrong, but larger things have to be addressed other than child labor, adults should make at least enough from their work to be able to feed their kids too.

We cannot make a United States of Holland. You cannot build a levy around the coast lines of a whole world. And this is exactly what some authorities are suggesting, regardless of common sense, regardless of the facts sitting right in front of our eyes.\r\n \r\nOnce again, we have been reminded of the most obvious fact -- that nature (like an ocean) is going to go where ever nature wants. Placing the majority of a country's population along one coast line that was suceptible to hurricanes was just looking for trouble.\r\n \r\nWhat we should be doing now is asking ourselves how would you honestly classify the investment value of a city, like New Orleans, that has levies on all sides and resides well below the level of the ocean, and will one day flood permanently? And in sorting through the debris that is New York City and Hoboken, how do we avoid the fact that we have more than just one New Orleans right here in in the present to deal with.\r\n\r\nThis whole business about "shining cities by the sea" said nothing about how dry they would be.

I honestly don't believe there was even an error on misfiled paperwork.  I believe that this shelter, knowing this dog was being quarantined for jumping on a pizza guy, took it upon themselves to kill this poor dog.  We lived in Georgia for three years, and you would be shocked and appalled at how often the drivers down there would purposely swerve to hit the dogs that would wander onto the roads.  Iam so sorry for this family and what they are going through. It is a shame that this young man had to suffer this loss in such a devastating manner, without preparing him for, what Iam assuming, is his first loss of a pet.

Different magazines get different results because of the driving, not the car. The EPA performs very scientific tests to estimate MPG. And remember, its only an estimate. All the commercials even say estimate. You cannot rely on that number to be true for all drivers.  \r\n Driving behavior is the #1 killer of MPG. If you drive over 60 MPH on the freeway, you won't match the EPA estimates. If you accelerate hard, you might as well throw dollar bills out the window. If you speed, no way will you get EPA numbers.  \r\n I drive a 98 civic that is rated around 40 MPG highway and can easily get that. The car is 16 years old with almost 200,000 miles and I get better MPG than most newer compact cars. It is how you drive that effects MPG, not the number on the window sticker.

I get 13% on my investments in good growth stock mutual funds. I never carried debt, and do not have a credit card to my name. I also saved and paid cash for a condo.

Something to think about:  if you reversed the genders in your story you would be considered a chauvenist, sexist jerk, for claiming that it's "your" money and that your spouse was a kept woman.     \r\n  \r\nWhat's good for the gander is good for the goose.

Sorry jw but I have been retired for 2 years and have been able to avoid all your problems, but I did set in motion a few things that I will share with you. First got rid of the house, now the teachers union and the rest of the leaches here in NY state can't tax me anymore for my property. NY state also doesn't tax my SS and exempts 20k of my pension and with the personal deduction of 7500, why I am poor in the state's eyes. The Federal gov is different situation, no matter where you live. Down sized the cars to one, walk to the store etc, and drive very little so gas, well who cares what that goes up to. Next got all my money out of the stock market tired of watch the rigged game go against me. And moved just about all into gold and silver. That way when everyone else as you say routine bills are going up, guess what you real money is worth the same in purchasing power, you never lose ground. And everyday as barry and benny and the ink jet keep printing more and more worthless Federal Reserve notes, why my real money keeps growing. And since I have tons of time, I don't buy anything unless it is on sale, pre Christmas, birthday shop etc, and food shopping the same. So cheer up I know the country is in the tubes and you can't save it, but you can save yourself, good luck, because after Nov 6th we are sure going to need it.

In a tough economy, I think this might be a great way to make some extra cash. Mmm..I wonder who I should accuse of having their way with me? How about Jennifer Lopez? All I have to do is get her to take me out to dinner and a movie and "wallah" I'll be rich.

Science is not about "proof."  Proof is in mathematics and logic.  But there is good evidence and sound logic that make it likely that the majority of the warming we are currently experiencing is anthropogenic.  Scientists have known the therm-chemical properties of CO2 since the 1800s.  That's not liberal conspiracy. That's fact. There's no scientific reason to think that CO2 in the wild has different chemical properties than the CO2 in the lab.  It was postulated by Arrhenius also in the 1800s that this increased CO2 in the atmosphere would cause global warming (but he thought it was a good thing).      That's not liberal conspiracy - it's science history. \r\nhttp://www.aip.org/h  ​ istory/climate/co2.h  ​ tm\r\n\r\nModern scientists agree with Arrhenius, but they don't think it's necessarily a good thing.\r\nhttp://climate.nasa.  ​ gov/causes/\r\n\r\nThe actual scientists have looked at all these other things - sun, natural cycles - and they AGREE that some global warming is caused by those things, but when all that is accounted for there is extra warming - and it corresponds to the  rise expected from the increased GHG content.\r\n\r\nhttp://earthobservat  ​ ory.nasa.gov/Feature  ​ s/GlobalWarming/page  ​ 4.php

Many traffic enforcement officers are trained to make traffic stops last at least 20 minutes! It's sort of "free advertising" for other drivers to slow down! \r\n \r\nBecause the economy is still in recovery, there are many more zealous traffic enforcement enforcers unwilling to give breaks to the violators, unless they are cute! It still gets the 20 minute treatment, but the women get special treatment!\r\n \r\n I can't tell you how many times I hear girls telling me they have been stopped dozens of times and are now whining because one policeman had the hubris to actually give them a ticket!\r\n \r\nPersonally, I have had been issued a ticket all but one time I was stopped in the last 35 years! I am never rude, and accept my fate, as I have been roughed up for just being tall and standing up too fast getting out of a vehicle. I make sure to be apologetic and courteous for not watching my speed, but I still get a ticket 99% of the time! \r\n \r\nSadly, the police mentality is that those causing "traffic congestion" that causes most of the accidents are the last folks ever to be pulled over! For some reason, speeders are more fun! In every courtroom I have ever been in, it is always 50 to one, speeders over those causing a traffic hazard!  Those that pass the hazarders to get them into our rearview mirrors along with the hoard that accompanies them are the biggest beneficiary of traffic violations! It's not fair! \r\n \r\nThe only advice I can offer is this: Policemen hate to pull over dirty cars.\r\nIf we remember to check our rearview mirrors often, and check on-ramps as we pass them, we can usually detect the clever cops and adjust our speed and escape the fickle finger of law enforcement.\r\n \r\nSome police, have now added hiding their silent, Bavarian, un-American motorcycles behind recycle bins and low signs in parking lots, presenting an even bigger challenge to seeing them before they lock on and make their monthly quotas!\r\n \r\nLook everywhere! The enforcers are bound to be in their usual parking lots near donut shops and fast food, too.\r\n \r\nGood Luck!

VM, you are absolutely correct.  Thankfully, these are some of the things we researched and discussed before she made the decision to give it a shot.  Additionally, nursing school was extremely difficult.  When she graduated and passed the NCLEX she couldn't find a job ANYWHERE.  It wasn't because none were available, rather, because it is a highly skilled position and hospitals wanted experience.  The awesome thing about her however, was that she was a natural at it.  She loved the field genuinely.  While in school she got her CNA license and since she couldn't find a nursing job, she worked as a CNA for a while.  Eventually, God opened a door and she got a great job at a hospital and is now a charge nurse.

All these majors are EASY.  They are default options for frat boys, sorority girls, athletes, and students in general who are not academically-incline  ​ d.  The World is all about production.  Smoking weed, talking philosophy accomplishes NOTHING.  Majors that gets you jobs that allow you a comfortable living are the ones that are HARD, specifically, quantitative.  Companies need these skills, but less and less American students pursue it because we raised a generation of quitters and entitlement whores that were never taught the concept of perseverance.  Parents telling kids, "you don't have to do anything you don't want to do" and "you are awesome at everything" have turned this generation into disillusioned weaklings.  The biggest favor you can do for your emo kids is to advise them to pursue these majors and minors.

It's not the government job to look after your personal savings.  That's between you and the private institution that you bank with.  If you want a higher return, take your money and do something else.  Banks are only going to pay what they need to, which it turns out is basically nothing, to get people to use them as risk free warehouses for their money.  If you want a larger return you need to sacrifice security (FDIC insurance) or liquidity.

@ Mary - Let's address some of your talking points: \r\n1) The economy:  You do realize taht the economy went in the tank as the result of     clinton's      failed housing policies, right?  The ones that got shoved down the throats of the banks.\r\n2) How desperate the dums must be to crow over obuma giving a "go" order for a military mission backed by the entire Joint Chiefs.  Maybe it was just that obuma finally agreed to something.\r\n3) obuma-scare (or HC) is a horrible bill that was forced upon the American public that did not want it.  Even obuma's own advisors say that it can not succeed financially.  It will take the entire medical idustry down.\r\n4) Saved the auto industry?  Really?  What were we going to do for cars?  To think that is very naive.

My husband was pulled over going 25 mph over the speed limit (90mph)  in his red, convertible Camaro.  The officer asked him where he was going in such a hurry and my husband explained he was late to work.  The officer took his time running his plate and license and when he came back told my husband "Next time slow down- I won't pull you over and you might actually make it to work on time and ALIVE."  He didn't get a ticket, was 15 minutes late to work and after that he slowed down.  Thank you Officer!

"Gloom is not a strategy.... it is a feeling....." oh yea right, that feeling depends where you are in the grand scheme of things or where you are standing in the unemployment line. For elderly retired folks with incomes that did not go up in how many years.... but the cost of food and fuel does not count you understand...... buying cars and shirts and electronic gadgets will not give us heat this winter, finding $2 longjohns at the Salvation Army might help. Listening to Mr. Cramer on TV a few times talking about things he purchases for his kids, yup that is wonderful to do for your family, but like the major poliitcos he has no clue what us below average income people are facing, he can't see far enough down the ladder. Santa long ago retired in my world but some of those lumps of coal would be helpful about now. Lies, damn lies, or statistics, take your pick.

Well on a bright Sunday Morning in Dallas I had my 69 Convertible Firebird out for a early morning Drive. I enter the Bush Tollway off I30  at 6:15 AM with Nobody on the road and decided it was time to air out the exhuast. Well about 1 mile and foot firmly plainted to the floor I crested  a small rise and there was the DPS Trooper. I stomped the brakes He turned on the lights and I knew I was going to Jail. The officer pulled up behind me and did not even have to get on the highway 4 wheel disc brakes worked really good. Wallet on dash keys on dash and hands on the wheel. The Trooper came to the door and asked if I knew how fast I was going and I said with a smile on my face "Really Fast Officer" he took my license and insurance and came back to the window with them after about 15 minutes. He askled the last time I had gotten a ticket I rfeplied almost 20 years ago. He asked why did you not run you had the jump on me I replied where would I go on a Sunday morning in a blinding bright YELLOW convertible? And Besides I really dont want to go to Jail.  He laughed and asked to look under the hood I politely obliged. After some other questions he looked me dead in the face and said Mr Ray you ned to slow the _ ell down  I clocked you at  145 mph your free to go. Yes Sir was all I could say and I closed the hood and drove away. I dont drive fast anymore I think I used up all my get out of jail free cards on that 1 stop.

Well, there you go. Three more people that I'm so fortunate not to live near. She didn't just 'simply answer the question". She put down her neighbor. And like the other poster said she neglected to mention if that neighbor was in violation of any of the HOA's rules so we have to assume she isn't. To have to talk about her neighbor's decorations like they are just oh so horrible is stupid. None of her business and if she doesn't like it she doesn't have to look. And as for you 'maggs', you need some reading skills. Stating that she puts up decorations is far different from saying "adorn her doors, porch and sidewalk/steps with a plethora of holiday crafty stuffff, we all know months in advance to which holiday is approaching". That's more of a snooty put down type of remark and not quite as innocent as you tried to paint it. As for 'lame attempts', look in the mirror deary. The busy body was the one you were defending.

YOU know the Unions is and will be the back bone was once a time back they where more in the demanding it was one time if you had relatives in the Union you could get in with out being judged because the old quote " more kin you are better to get in " now remember this " the eight hour work day who gave you all this...what about the overtime pay policy who gave you this...what about having a safe work place where you can go home without being the the grave who gave you this....plus who frights for your dam rights more than your stupid mouth who does this, now history the coal miner is and the for one to look at they are the grandfather of all unions...who suffer more deaths because of there collective bargaining on the lines the miner go to Luglow/CO and WV, people yes the unions has weakened but its not Congress, its own members and the presidents of the unions they vote for agreements and these agreements are at times for the contractor that the hall has, just think about this what would the far fathers say about it now come on MILLER wake up and say something, when change occurs it makes things weaker specially when there are projects that needs Brothers/Sisters and they cannot man them they us the White ticket and then offer them union status, but now it more political instead what is was the old days was the most fun plus it was more serious attitube instead now, the young bucks/apprentices are not wanting to pay attention the to journeyman and learn from him those are the ones needs to be out don't get numbers get PRIDE back then things will get better lets build off the foundation but don't change what was started just strengthen it by individuals that  believe in PRIDE and don't label everybody accept each other has they are thank you

I'm glad I'm not in his area. To defend yourself not only does the insurance company take you to the cleaners, the court does too. Defend yourself and get a stiffer penalty! That our legal system at work. Local cities with reduced property values have seen a dramatic drop in income from property taxes and do use traffic citations to supplement this reduced revenue. Why do they always wait right where the speed changes or on the downside of a hill? Because thats where they will catch a good driver making a mistake. Easy money! It's a lot easier than actually driving around and catching the real menaces on the road.

Oh another bright one...So who do you think the Republican Party kow-tows with? If there wasn't a need in the first place...then unions would not of come into existence..get it. When you have a REPUBLICAN who says to allow a company to go bankrupt simply so their financial obligations including pensions that employees themselves paid into can be wiped off the slate then you are not for your fellow neighbors and friends. I do agree that as long as there is Big C kow-towed with Big G, then there better be a Big U to keep some things in check or we all would be without any security whatsoever.

1 CLASSIC LADY: you've never been out of work. your husband works to keep the lights on so you can blog away the day hating on our President because you are old, white and fearful to tell the truth about the success President Obama has improving these jobs numbers and growing the stock market from the Bush abyss. How long did it take to recover from the Great Depression? Classic, it took almost 30 years and a world war to get it behind us. Obama has cleared us from the Bush Depression in only one term. I say give him 8 more and thank him for the tremendous job he has done keeping the lights on for you. MisterKyte, the White House just sent out a press release explaining what happened in Benghazi but it won't satisfy you because you will continue your attacks on our President. Proof is in the pudding so get a spoon out in a week because President Obama will be victorious. VOTE OBAMA!!! Mayor of \r\nNew York City endorses Obama because NYC only chooses winners.

The "crisis" did not arise outta the Bush administration because of policies - Clinton's policies on loosening housing loan regulation was a large part of it.  The DotCom bubble and 9/11 were also large contributors.  Plus 4 years would have been plenty of time to set the economy back on a growing course instead of trying to creat a new entitlement program that eats up 1/6 of the budget and only creates another huge pot of money politicans can syphon off of like SS and medicare.

Reading these comments I see you are determined to ridicule anything said by Romney and take no effort to understand the meaning.  If Obama had said the same thing you would be praising him to the heavens for being so smart and understanding.  Bunch of Hypocrits.  In this case Romney did make a very valid point.  You don't just go in haphazardly and throw your resources a little here and and a little there and hope that if you smatter the board with enough resources the rest will fix it'self.  The most effective way to deal with a disaster is to borrow from Romney to define your lanes and and your goals and direct resources into those lanes with purpose.  Lanes in a disaster will be everything from human assistance(getting people to safety, feeding, sheltering, clothing) to Infrastucture (Power, roads, bridges) to restorative assistance (getting non basic services back up)  These lanes of assistance need to be defined before hand so everyone knows what their responsibility will be.  \r\nThose of you here claiming that the statement is retarded should perhaps look inward.

America's system IS guilty until proven innocent. If you truly believe the system treats you as "innocent until proven guilty" then you are horribly, horribly mistaken.

The cooks at my restaurant make 13-15 an hour, which is made possible because the owners don't have to pay the servers at least minimum wage. Average servers make about 15/hr with their tips and hourly wages. It balances out.

Give me a dark bar room, a bold deep voice with  a worn out guitar bellowing out the soul of what the heart feels.. That .. my friends... Is COUNTRY  !!!

When Bill Clinton had left Office, George Bush didn't inherit an economy that was on its knees, as did Barack Obama from Bush, my friend. And, albeit US with its back against the wall in two wars on foreign soil: Iraq and Afghanistan, and having to finance these misadventures from the Tax Payer's money without any prospect for Profit. Two Wars based on untruth concocted and manufactured by Bush, Blair and their cohorts in conspiracy! \r\n\r\nNor did Bush inherit from Clinton a war-mongering policy of misadventures on foreign soil that was eating away at the coffers of the US Treasury, as did Bush's and Cheney's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan! Wake up my friend, Bush ran aground Uncle Sam in his 10 years of  mediocre and motivated management, which more benefited his cronies and Dick Cheney, et al, than the US. He whittled away all the money that Clinton had left, and gave Obama a begging bowl. Moreover, Obama had inherited Bush's two Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which had surmised to have become a quick-sand quagmire for the USA both economy and foreign policy wise. Where was Bush's 1.6 trillion US Dollars for Obama at the end of the day?\r\n\r\nWake up my friend: Yesterday, 1st of November, Bob Shrum, a veteran strategist for the Democrat's Presidential Elections, appeared on Hard Talk on the BBC; his prognosis: Bush's Wars nailed the coffin on the US economy along with his Tax Cuts for the rich. Also, please read NYT's Thomas L. Friedman's column on 29 September 2012 titled "The World We're Actually Living In", an eloquent commentary on war-mongering stupidity of the yester years and the harm it has done to the USA. Offers poignant pointers on replication of the same war-mongering psyche of the GOP by Mitt Romney and its dire consequences.  \r\n\r\nDo your homework dispassionately my friend, and you''d get the right answers. Thinking and acting like an Ostrich burrowing its head in the sands would get you no where. You require an objective approach based on history, facts and empiricism rather than subjective and partisan jaundice-eye if at all you want to arrive at the truth.  \r\n\r\nClinton didn't leave the USA in a mess. George W. Bush Jr did. That's GOP for you.\r\n\r\nThanks

This article only tells part of the story.  In the first place, the "typical" worker in this country never earned anywhere near $74K.  For most people, even with a college degree, if they ever earned more than $40-$50K a year, they were very fortunate.  Secondly, retirement costs vary significantly from one part of the country to another.  In many areas in the country's interior, with a paid-for house and a modest lifestyle, people can retire comfortably on $40K a year.  In other areas, specifically large costal cities, $40K per year might get you "a van down by the river".

Less than a week before the presidential election, Christie will host Obama in New Jersey to survey Sandy damage. The governor created a buzz after saying this week that he had no intention of bringing the GOP nominee to the Garden State to survey storm damage first-hand.Folks don’t know the situation here following the storm,” a Christie adviser told POLITICO when asked if the governor is unhappy with the GOP nominee \r\nChristie has been a frequent campaigner and fundraiser for Romney, appearing with him most recently in Ohio. Christie cancelled campaign appearances for Romney in Nevada that had been slated to occur on Tuesday after it was clear the storm was headed to his state. \r\nThe governor told Fox News that he has bigger things to worry about than the campaign. \r\n“I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,” he said when asked if Romney would visit. “I’ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that’s much bigger than presidential politics, and I could care less about any of that stuff.”

$3.00 an hour? The federal minimum wage is $7.25. If the server doesn't make at least $7.25 through tips, the restaurant MUST make up the difference. NOBODY can legally make under $7.25.

Why?! I love this boots. It may be an ugly looking to others but this is my best boots for winter. My feet gets really really cold on winter. This boots is amazing because it keeps my feet warm and the quality of it is what i'm amaze by it. I never had boots that keeps me warm all winter long....However, their price went up a little higher. Why is that? I think people stop buying them because of the high price. I had mine for 4 yrs and i'm thinking of buying them this year but i'm still having second thoughts. I would probably buy the leather ones so it will last me for few more years than the suede one.

Its up to the workers that live in NJ. Its their jurisdiction. Would you let people come into your house if you did not want them there? If you know the majority of workers in NJ are union and you yourself are not union and expect to just come in and go to work with no problems, you are either dumb or arrogant. If you dont love it , leave it. The whole reason that non union workers and union workers for that matter would want to go to work there would be because of the prevailing wages there. I cant blame anyone for wanting to make a better wage. You critics are the only idiots that dont seem to understand that. On Monday when you go to work, why dont you tell your bosses that you are all grosely overpaid and think that you should take a cut in pay because you dont want to be compared to over compensated lazy union workers. Unions built this country, we will build it again, and again, and again.

While I agree that the quote isn't as bad as MSN wants us to believe it is and that it is simply an analogy for what should be done in Sandy's wake, I do have to say that perhaps he should be more straightforward. Also, I cannot agree that what Pres. Obama said was wrong in any way; he never said that we don't use bayonets anymore, but just that we have fewer because there are other specialized weapons that can be used. Never did I hear him downplay their importance, but, rather, show that there is no need to over compensate (something that would also attract criticism).

Thanks Airdog for doing your job and helping keep the road safe for those of us who do our best to obey all traffic laws. I live in western Colorado and have a 32 year perfectly clean mvr. I have been pulled over twice, both times for tail lights being out on my boat trailer in Rifle. Once was a blown bulb, the other was connector vibrated loose in Delta. I can't understand why so many people think they are gaining so much by going faster. 65 to 75 will only make about 3 minutes difference from Delta to Grand Junction. Is 3 minutes really worth the possibility of getting a ticket and higher insurance or even having a bad wreck? Not to me, it isn't. I"ll leave 5 minutes earlier to get where I have to be at a certain time. To all of you who give me a thumbs down for this post, use that thumb to count the bills out when you pay your next ticket.  And while you are wasting 10 minutes waiting for the officer to write that ticket, I will have already passed you and still got where I'm going 2 minutes early.

Service would have to be really, really bad, like borderline criminial, for me to stiff the server. What gets me is that I am supposed to tip anyone who works in the food industry. There are even tip jugs for places where they don't bring the food to your table, i.e. Moe's. \r\n \r\nI know single mothers that are like this. They feel that they are entitled to nice things, so they spend money on "luxuries" and then expect others to pick up the tab on other things.

My daughters and I love our Ugg boots, we wear them all the time except in the summer. We have a couple of pairs each. Maybe they should consolidate the style and stop with the colored and shiny stuff, stick with the natural and basis styles and make them more affordable. Otherwise, people will continue to buy the knock offs.

Myth #1: AGW is a hoax because Al Gore has beachfront property, proving he's not afraid of rising seal levels.\r\n\r\nFACT 1: What Al Gore thinks, believes, says, or does has no bearing on the science of AGW.\r\nFACT 2: Al Gore's house is 2 miles from the beach and 500 ft above sea level.\r\n\r\nAl Gore's house in Montecito, CA: http://virtualglobet  ​ ​rotting.com/states/  ​ C​A/Montecito/\r\n\r\nHere's the detailed information:  http://virtualglobet  ​ ​rotting.com/map/al-  ​ g​ores-house-2/\r\n\r\nThat site gives the following lat / lon:   34.448538,-119.62868  ​ 2\r\n\r\nCopy that into a google search bar and it should bring up the location in google maps.  Zoom out.  From that alone you can eyeball it to see the house is AT LEAST 2 Km from the beach.\r\n\r\nThere's an application called GoogleEarth which I highly recommend, but you have to install it on your computer.  If you do that, copy-paste the lat / lon into the search bar for GoogleEarth.  It will automatically zoom to that location.  You can see that the elevation for it is 511 ft. ASL (ASL=above sea level)\r\n\r\nIt's zoomed in too far, so zoom out until you see the coast.  Click on the ruler in menu bar.  Click and release the mouse over the coastline approximately closest to the house.  Move to the house (marked with a pin), click again.  go to the little popup menu that currently reads about 2 miles and change the display to kilometers.  It reads 3.25 Km. \r\n\r\nSummary:  House is 2 miles as the crow flies from the coast and 500 feet ASL.\r\nConclusion: Not "beachfront" and in no danger of AGW caused sea flooding.

Same for Mary Landrieu. \r\n  \r\nLeaders lead i.e.Chris Christie.  Losers blame i.e. Obama, Nagin, Biden, etc...

Appearing on the networks this morning, Christie, for the third day in a row, heaped praise on Obama’s handling of the storm. “The President has been outstanding in this,” he told the “Today” show. On “Morning Joe,” he said, “It’s been very good working with the President. He and his Administration have been coördinating with us. It’s been wonderful.” Speaking on CNN, Christie said that he had been mightily impressed by Obama’s accessibility throughout the crisis. “He gave me his number at the White House, told me to call him if I needed anything, and he absolutely means it.” Christie also pointed out that Obama didn’t once bring up politics in their conversations, and added, “If he’s not bringing it up, you can be sure that people in New Jersey are not worried about that, primarily if one of the guys running isn’t."

If this is proven to be true; OUR Governor needs to go after the union with a vengeance.  There are people out there who are having a very hard time and to get into a union girl fight with others whom are here to assist getting our state back up and running.  The union MUST be held accountable and the leaders need to be jailed.  It is nothing more than criminal to turn away crews from other states when we are in a crisis just because they don’t belong to their pus%# union group.  I would fire them all and bring in the military to get the job done; just like President Ragan did with the air traffic controllers.  Activate the Guard and Reserves and give them the good paying jobs, they deserve it, the puss& Unions do not…….

My family (on Long Island,) is still without power, of course. But, we are very lucky to have some limited access to generator power.  \r\n The biggest problem is finding fuel for that. The house(s), the cars pretty much everything is trashed right now. They can't get into the city to work either. \r\n Again, we are blessed that they merely lost all their possessions. \r\n Everyone around them is in the same shape. \r\n And we still have each other.

I think 5 percent would be acceptable on Certificates of Deposit.  Perhaps liquid savings somewhat less.   That is the benchmark I am waiting for, anyway.  Regardless, however, I am still maintaining CD capital in CDs.  The money in other investments are still being maintained at that level and venue as well.  Its just my personal preference.

Wow, I am not even a single mom (I am married with 2 kids) and would not pay that for one meal. I do not live in a big city and a meal for 4 at Applebee's is around 50.00 for 2 adults and 2 kids. She was fully aware of the price tag when she went in: if you cannot afford to tip, don't go. I have never "not" left a tip but, I have scaled it way back for extremely poor service (that was the waitresses fault, poor kitchen service results in a complaint directly to the kitchen) That is what I spend on a week's worht of groceries, I really hope this was a hoax otherwise she should be hainging her head in shame!

I like the way you think. I can't help but wonder why so many have to feel better about themselves by degrading others. I always though marriage was an equal partnership. Not a caste system.  If you do more work than the other person, male or female, maybe you need to get out unless there is a health reason or something. Been in relationships like that and if you don't at least try for 50/50, well then we need to rethink the whole thing. \r\n  \r\nStop competing for leadership with the one you love the most and just cooperate.

That's a lesson he should have learned long before he was 10. If it was me and I had some smart-a** little kid tell me NO when I tell him to do something...he will be learning a lesson, perhaps not with a Taser, but something that is obviously shake him up and make one heck of a memory so that kid will think twice the next time!!!

Obviously, the word has been irreverently overused by those with a limited vocabulary and an insensitive attitude.  Gov. Romney is using his analogy of cleanup as evidence of his leadership and willingness to roll up his sleeves to aid others.  Look at BO with his phoney Photo-op in NJ.  Never visited NYC or lifted a finger for those devastated citizens there.  Pledged taxpayer money to help the "Jersey Shore".  What a faker in chief.

The systems we allow to shape our lives are camouflaged as serving us when in fact, we the people are the servants. It seems even the institutions and activist groups with altruistic beginnings are infiltrated by instruments of chaos or control. \r\n\r\nI hear only silence while executive orders, signed in seclusion, override our constitution. Our lawmakers provide more restrictions than FREEDOM, with little thought to our pursuit of happiness . \r\nSocial engineering creates dependence and constrictions rather than independence and individual growth. I see the misuse of our military, in my name, to destroy thousands of innocent lives in sovereign countries that have done us no harm. We are ruled by BUREAUCRATS and threatened by AGENCIES. \r\nIt has to stop..

I went in twice to my local Hyundai dealer to express concern and irritation at the lower than expected mileage I was getting. I am not a teen driver; I am 59 and very careful how I drive. \r\nThey kept telling me that it would get the mileage as soon as it was broken in. The salesman had said before we bought the car that it would most likely exceed the mileage when I drove it off the lot. Even on the highway, I never got the mileage promised. The managers at the dealership claimed all kinds of things that just never added up.\r\nI am glad that there will be some payback, but 1 mile per gallon is not enough for my experience. I would never have complained twice had it only been off one or two miles per gallon.\r\nThe article says that the payback is for one year. What about the fact that we will be unable to afford another car for at least two years? I do not get reimbursed for those years.

I'd like to see ANY press coverage of the other candidates for President (the ones no one ever gets to hear about because they are neither Democrats nor Republicans), an end to the 2 party dominant system, an end to the Electoral College, and an end to pre-election polling. I believe all of these factors have undue influence on the outcome of the election. For example, if I support a candidate who is trailing in the polls, and I understand the Electoral College process, what is my incentive to cast my vote? Because of the polls I know my County/Parish/Distri  ​ ct will be awarded to one candidate, along with my State, and that candidate will be awarded electoral votes. My one vote means nothing in this process. We've already seen two elections in American history where the candidate lost the popular vote but won the election because of the Electoral College, and I don't believe this is the best possible way to elect our President.

I liked the post as well and have the same answer as SoII.  I, too, made enough to float my own boat so to speak but what I always wondered, was, why do men bother getting married?  There are enough women out there to enjoy without getting tied down.  On the other hand, there are all kinds of jobs now that are open to women so why do they want the tie downs as well. Why not enjoy each other and not tie knots and wind up with anchors.

I guess I am one of the lucky women in this world to have an amazing man. We just got married March 30, 2012. My husband has always helped me with the laundry, dishes, kids homework, etc. This is his first marriage and my 2nd. I know that I Iearned from the first time never take my husband for granted. He may never have been married before but he has had some pretty crappy relationships so he doesn't take me for granted. As a married couple we know that in the end when our children grow up and make their own lives that it will be just the 2 of us. He is my best friend and I vowed to never take him for granted. I have seen marriages fall apart because of one partner expecting more than they are willing to give (my first marriage). I am thankful everyday for the wonderful relationship my husband and I have. Good luck to both the men and women getting married

Barack HUSSEIN Obama did NOT "save GM" - he saved the unions. Had GM declared bankruptcy, they would NOT have ceased makinga single automobile; would NOT have closed a single plant - they would have gotten out from under the restrictive union contracts that demand high wages and high benefits that cripple GM. \r\nThe unions own the DemocRATS and the DemocRATS are beholden to the unions. \r\nNew Jersey is the most unionized state in the country - ALWAYS votes for DemocRATS - will vote to reelect Obama.

The second you put on a fresh pair of real UGS that fit perfectly you understand the hype.  If you're like me and could care less what others think about them, they're worth every penny.  My 1st pair lasted 12 years.  I suppose I would have replaced them earlier if they were less expensive.  Knock-offs were never an option, because I wasn't going for the look.  I think UGGs having financial issues because they've departed from their original design and started making really outlandish styles.  I think as a company they're forced back to basics.  At the end of the day, they still make a superior product.

I drive Prius, milage king in America.  MY mileage is just under 50 mpg but I have notice that when I am driving by one of those mileage checks  on the highway that tell you what your speed is at the moment, they always understate what my speed is according to my speedometer.  In other words if they show 30 mph and my speedometer shows 32 mph then my car is overstating my speed which would also overstate my mpg if you think about it.  Consumer report does a test on a 150 mile test trip where they show the MPG for that trip.  It is the most accurate figure I have seen for mpg out there.  By the way they show my car averages 44.5 mpg the best of all cars.  Even though my car shows more than that i believe they are probably correct. On another note Ford is shamefully overstating their gas mileage on TV commercials.  Sick 'em EPA!

Unfortunately dogs are sometimes allowed to behave like animals and jump on pizza guys when  unsupervised -- a human error, not the dog's. The second human error cost the dog his life, and heartache for all involved. Please, if you are responsible for a pet, either as an owner or a caregiver, realize that the pet is relying on you 100% for its care and protection.  \r\nWith respect to the unintentional euthanization, I would think a highly visible tag or collar might have helped prevent it.

MrKyte, why do you support the party of bigger government and more spending, in 2001 Federal spending was $1.9 trillion, after 8 years of a Republican in the White House, spending rose to $3.5 trillion in just 8 years, by 2009 almost doubling. From 2009 to 2013 with Obama in the White House spending has increased to $3.8 trillion, just $300 billion, barely enough to keep up with inflation. So why does anybody believe that the party that increased spending by $1.6 trillion per year, is better qualified than the party who increased it $300 billion ?

@ christine yergeau   Toronto is so diverse and tolerant of different cultures that embracing their differences is key to everything there.  That said I haven't yet seen what this amazing city has to offer first hand but I do have a cousin who made Toronto his home after growing up in Montreal. I was in Ottawa once because I had the pleasure of staying at The Chateau Montebello before the Fairmont Group bought it but never had the time to enjoy the Provonce. I am from VT and my people came from Quebec to the states a few generations ago. I was  fortunate enough to spend a month every summer with relatives in Montreal  since I was around 12 years old. I witnessed the Quebecois battling for French domination from the late sixties into the early seventies. After four years of French in High School and that month every summer growing up I was almost fluent in French.  As a young man I returned many times when I lived less than 3 hours away in Burlington VT for obvious reasons.  Just as you did not refer to all Americans as haters...  I will not refer to all Canadians as lovely people . \r\nThis is not directed at the citizens of Toronto . The Quebecois can be rude and downright insulting to  the Americans spending money in their quite beautiful city of Montreal . I used to find it amusing since they were mainly bi-lingual and when I would listen to them trash my friends and myself in French ,to reply to them in French ,especially local slang to let them know that some Americans can speak French. The looks on their faces were priceless . However I do not paint all French speaking Montreal citizens with the same brush . To me French is a beautiful language and they are proud of their heritage as they should be. I feel lucky to grow up in two worlds but when the "Language Police " started measuring signs and would  fine business owners" if the English signs were too large compared to the  mandatory French ratio of being bigger is just silly. Also this talk of seceding from Canada is crazy . Even the recent victory for the Quebecois which I applaud the first lady ever to be elected to her position and her election victory albeit bittersweet when the shooter tainted it  they are a minority party and have said themselves there will be no talk of seceding from Canada for years to come but... \r\n  \r\nAny country or sizable group numbers wise is going to have the same percentages of deviants, criminals , and so on. \r\n  \r\nI still love Canada and comparing them with Americans I must say at a glance they are a polite society but not perfect. \r\nThanks for Listening. \r\nJohn H.

To-"Youve_GOT_To_Be_  ​ Joking"--Why are you being so upset and telling me I don't know diddly squat about you?  First of all, I did not personally attack you.  Iam very sorry that you had the hard time that you had raising your sibling.  My heart really does go out to you.  I did not know your history, so please don't assume that I think I have any insight into your life.  The fact that it seems I have hit a nerve about your "attitude" makes me wonder if what I said, does indeed pertain to you-that perhaps, because you did your best and gave your all to your sibling, that maybe you actually do feel you didn't do your best somehow.   I know the quality of life was certainly not easy years ago.  My dad was not treated very well by his parents and punished quite often.  I was just stating the obvious, that families were always very large generations ago.   I do agree with you that so many children get lost in the cracks.  There is also the age  in which you had to start taking care of  your sibling.  You were a teen and the Duggars didn't start their family until they were married and in their twenties.  I certainly never meant to offend you, and I do commend you on what must have been a very difficult, long and hard road  and the fact that you lost a parent, must have been a very hard and painful experience at such a young age to cope with.

I know a guy, a friend, who turned down work as a pipe fitter for my dad because they were non union.  The starting wage was 25.00/hr, but they didn't contribute to his pension, so he turned it away.  I'd give his name and city, but that wouldn't be fair as a friend.  The company my dad works for may not pay into an employee pension, but they offer good medical and 401k matching.  Union thugs brainwash their members to think Union or the highway.  No wonder we can't fix our infrastructure with that mentality.

I was not going to respond, but you have never been more wrong about somebody in your life. I am a good person, I have a great life and a strange sense of humor, I created some personas because someone was being an azzhole to Moxie, She shot me an email begging me to. she thanked me afterwards. I was always respectful to everybody, Including you. You were one of the funnist people I talked with and have always had fun. In about three days with outside help, what was a nice fun diversion has turned into and really ugly place. I have been accused of stalking, I have been accused of being a child molester, (My own daughter) I had mentioned my college degree and one of you three musketeers insisted I dont have a degree. I have been accused of posting my own address for perversion...I dont live in New York. I read a post where one of your buddies says I don't live in California. Tell that to my wife! I was getting frustrated and pissed of because for some reason, you want to believe every damn thing your red friend says. I liked you, I enjoyed the talks and the jokes. I I dont know why you are so ready to listen to somebody make up lies about me and try to turn me into some kind of monster. Feel free to file charges of harassment if you truly feel it is necessary.

I agree with most comments posted. Although I do like 'today's country', it can't even be compared to Reba, Faith Hill, Brooks & Dunn, etc. The biggest complaint I have is the Kelly Clarkson/Vince Gil duet. It was terrible! I would have thought Vince would have done most of the singing...since he IS a country artist...but no, it was basically all sung by Clarkson, who is and has never been a country artist (unless I missed something??!!) They should probably just start combining the pop awards shows and CMAs. It would save us all about 3 hours of our life.

I don't really understand these "Music Award Shows"  You already know who will win... There are about 10 -15 "country" singers left in the world according to the folks that do these shows. The winners are NOT chosen for talent, Taylor Swift has made that ABUNDANTLY clear!  Not that I am a "die-hard" country music fan but could someone tell me what happened to people like Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn... Martina McBride?  Did they all retire, pass-away?  When it comes to the men in "country music" you might as well hang that up!  Well, unless your Tim McGraw who has stooped to the level of setting fake confrontations with "out-of-control-men who chosen to pick a fight with a female counterpart directly in eye & ear shot of the stage! Of course Tim springs into action (along with a dozen or more strong-arms) to "rescue" said damsel in distress!  That was cool! well for the first time!  Then the second!  Then the third??? not so much, 4th time...nah 5th?? ok let's try something new here people!!!  Country Music is done. All you have is the shell and some really slick marketing people... The sad thing here really when there was actually a chance anyone could "make-it" in Nashville, some of the life-stories of what they went thru and how they dreamed for years just for the chance to be heard were wonderful to hear and read about! Also the "age limit" on Country stars is getting younger every year! The path we're on now within the next 10 years or so all the new "Hot-Talent" more then likely will be New born babies singing directly from the Nashville Hospital OG/GYN Department!  BUT, THEN ONLY IF they are: Female!  Blonde. Sized 1 or less, Under-weight... Not real "brite"  The traditional new baby blanket will have to be replaced by a skin-tight, low-cut "hooker-lite" styled dress.  With a minimum of 5 inch Heels!  .....An the winner for "Entertainer Of The Year, 2018" is...........

Do you know that in many states you can only sue for the monetary value of a pet?  That means if you took in a free kitten it has no monetary value and therefore you have no recourse to sue?  Horrible, I admit, but that is the law in my state and many others.  I have 4 "free" kittens and 2 dogs that I paid less than $50 each for each (pound fees) and every one of these are like my children and there is no amount of money that could replace their loss.  That's why I take serious precautions in my care of them.

People I know who have them say they're very comfortable, but I'm not willing to spend that much money on these ugly boots.  Maybe if they were sold for less than $50.. I might.. but they certainly wouldn't be those hideous silver ones on the photo.. they look like they belong on an astronaut.

I haven't watched the awards for years / nor commercial radio - it is all pop except for a few true country songs once in a blue moon. \r\n  \r\nI'm glad that I have Sirius XM for my vehicle and home.  Also, Music Choice through my cable TV service.  That's where I find the classic country with real twang.  I listen all day / every day ... it's just that good !!!

I'd call my lawyer. The officer needs to be held accountable; this really looks like aggravated assault. The problem is, when this happens, one is going to have a face-off with the local government and the general police culture. I've experienced bad behavior from law enforcement.  Redress is nearly impossible. They have authority, and they are armed. Getting the media involved can be a help.

Unions do act entitled sometimes but at same time if there was no organized labor to negotiate good wages then everyone would be at the mercy of companies. I'm willing to say there would be even more low paying jobs than there is now. I mean look at non union companies. Majority don't pay a wage that is equal to the cost of living, or offer decent insurance. Look at major company like walmart. Making billions in profit but dont pay that well. They offer insurance but you have to meet certain guidelinesto get it like hours worked, and they watch your hours like a hawk to make sure you dont get enough to qualify. I have two friends who have union jobs and make a very good living and they have never had contract issues. I'd love to be union. I know there is some bad but overall i think its worth it. People seem to think getting rid of unions would make things better. Wrong it'll ensure you have no say and even more cmpanies will adopt the take it and like it attitude as it pertains to wages and benefits

I can assure you not all animal shelters are created equally.  I have always gone to shelters for my animals, unless they find me themselves.  I went to a city owned shelter, thinking it was equivalent to the Human Society; my daughter was looking for a certain cat.  At the city shelter she found a kitten.  As we were checking out the “Red Flags” started flying up loud and clear; by the staff.  To make a long story short, they had totally neglected the cat that they had, had for months, even missing her shots.  The next day at the vets, I find out she was twice as old as the shelter  thought she was because she was so sick and malnourished.  Yes!!  She was a lucky little kitty, because she would of died where she was at, had we not taken her out of that city owned shelter.

The point is, it's not more appropriate to ask some guy on the street to clean out your car simply because you're an officer than it is in this situation. As life would have it, I am certianly not a "young mother" (though hey, I'll go with 29 again if you insist!) and am constantly on the receiving end of compliments for my children's behaviour from the staff at their schools. Furthermore, I come from a family of professional educators, serve on various school affiliated committees and volunteer regularly at the elementary school level. I am well aware of what a "career day" is supposed to be, and it most certainly does NOT involve cleaning out an officers messy vehicle. Your flimsy excuse for the officer of trying to teach teamwork falls flat because if that were the point the officer would have been there helping as well. It is vital that we not only teach our children to respect adults and others in authority, but that we also teach them when it is appropriate to refuse to follow orders that cross the line as well.

11 years ago Hunter Hayes was 9 years old!  I think maybe you are thinking of Wade Hayes.  If you're going to bash someone, at least get it right.  I'm not a fan of all the "rock" in country music, but apparently there are people that are buying the music and requesting it on the radio.  I do miss Reba, George, Alan and Conway's music.  I LOVE Pontoon, but not just for the lyrics......I love the music, it's such a catchy tune!  I thought many of the acts last night sounded horrible, but i'm not sure if that's their fault.  At most of the award shows that i watch, I'm not impressed by the singing.  I really do watch the Awards, to SEE who gets the awards.....so they could really shorten it all by omitting some of the singing acts and stick to awards.

Obama a SMUG person and it shows in this photo - even during the debates he seem annoyed that a person of his stature has to respond to commoners. In his 4 years, he is treated like a King and never has to answer to anyone as no one questions him. It's all yes sir! But now he actually has to deal with common voters that he is begging for their votes...you know his 47%....gays, lesbians, cross-genders, illegal Mexicans and of course his black race, who vote blindly for him. The most racist vote....we've ever seen in American politics. The brothers want him in, so the Free food stamps, free welfare, free healthcare continue for the next 4 years....then they might need to get a job!

I agree. 16 and pregnant makes me sick. Im and average person with one 5 year old and have been trying for years for another. I have gone thru medical testing and there are no answers, but yet these young girls have these babies, drag them all around town. Around random boyfriends and some how AMERICA loves it!!!! Seriously those babies are going to grow up and be able to watch that... How do you think it is going to impact them.... MTV should be embarrassed about that show. Being pregnant at 16 is something that you should be ashamed of not being broadcasted nationwide!!!!!

your claims of the country belonging to the natives the colonists stole it from is as old as the claims of slavery and the descendants being deserving of reparations.\r\nthe country has plenty of people who are white, but have no ancestry of owning slaves,\r\nno ancestry with the colonists,\r\nthere are a lot of people who also migrated to this country during the great depression,\r\nand just because of their skin being "white",\r\nthey get accused of being so privileged.\r\nsome of you will dig as deep as the BP oil wells to find some sort of justifications that you deserve what you get for you only claiming to being a minority,\r\nwhen in fact,\r\nyou're actually the majority.

Wow, $121.12 an hour for skilled labor. If I have no signed agreement or MOU with anyone, I can hire who I can afford...period! If they unionize and I can't afford what they are asking....I fold up, we all move on...it's all about choices. I either share in my millions of dollars in profits because we all know this is what it will amount to. If I can charge $500 an hour for services my employee will provide then I should be able to pay them a decent wage with benefits since they are usually the ones doing the hard dirty work out there. DUH...I get it now, unfortunately Unions don't always adjust their demands to the current situation...this makes them looks worse than they really are.

I am right there with you folks. I have enough staples,  beans,rice,pasta, seasoning ect stored to last 2 people for a year. Major rivers by my house so I don't worry about water much( do keep the bleach though) I do store about 10gl just in case. 2 4x4 vehicles and a generator. I try to keep at least 20 gl of fuel for the generator and keep all 4 of my vehicles full of gas just in case. You can buy freeze dried food in buckets of 200 meals for about 125.00 and it will store for 25 years I have a couple of these also. None of this is really expensive if you buy it a small amount at a time. \r\n Oh yeah, if it ever really goes down guns and ammo never hurts.

Hey Blonde, \r\n Since you're such a SAGE, I'd be interested in your take on the fact that ABC and CBS have both started OUTING Obama over the Benghazi Clusterphuk. \r\n Clearly the liberal media even realizes that if they continue to cover this up until after the election, what minuscule amount of cred that they have left, is toast! \r\n I guess it's probably "stupid" to bring this up too though. Right?

The strangest thing was from a drunk. My brother and i went to his house, did the trick or treat thing, then he poured a can of beer in my bag. No problem. Went home, got some hand soap, a dozen eggs, and you know the rest of the story. Went by his house the next day and listened to the cursing, and watched all the scrubbing on his house, and his car. Sometimes being nice on Halloween is a lot better than being mean to a kid................

I'm a cop in Colorado.  Let me clear up some things in this article that were either misstated or inaccurate. \r\n 1)  Police Officers/Troopers do NOT always have 100% discretion.  We have to log every stop on our daily activity log, or it is logged for us by the CAD system, and we have to note the outcome.  Often, we will be questioned as to why we stopped somebody going 65 mph in a 45 mph zone, for instance, and only gave them a warning. \r\n 2) Writing the speed on the ticket for less than the actual speed.  This is called a Courtesy Drop/Reduction.  As a police officer, you are responsible for telling the truth both on the ticket and in court.  When you write the ticket for less than the actual speed, and then have to go to court to testify, you have already tainted your testimony/case.  A smart lawyer will ask, "If you made a mistake on what what the speed was when you wrote the ticket, then surely there is a reasonable doubt that the charges are even accurate to begin with".  Or they will draw attention to the fact that you have already "lied" in writing the ticket. \r\n Also, it is against some department policies to issue Courtesy Drops.  Doing so, and getting caught, can result in your being fired. \r\n 3) "National Motorists Association ...spokesman John Bowman says not fighting a ticket is a mistake."  "Drivers will almost always come out ahead," he says, "either with a full dismissal or at least a lower penalty." \r\n Not true.  Most tickets today are Penalty Assessment tickets.  This means that if you pay the fine and keep it out of court, there is a reduction in points assessed against your license.  In Colorado, 20 mph over the limit is a 6 point charge.  This is reduced to 4 points if you pay the fine and don't go to court. \r\n If you go to court, and are found guilty, you will be assessed the 6 points.  The officer's opinion is strongly taken into consideration when the judge decides to issue any reduction in points.  If I have to show up in court to contest a ticket, I will recommend the full number of points.  That's the "deal" with a penalty assessment ticket. \r\n Also, many jurisdictions do not offer deferred adjudication.  Mine doesn't.  And, I don't lose many cases in court.  Only a couple over a 10 year period. \r\n 4) Finally, if a person confesses that they made a mistake and deserve whatever they get, I usually do not feel the need to write a ticket.  They are taking responsibility for their mistake, and this is the best sign that they will watch themselves in the future.  I have corrected the problem by voluntary compliance with the law on the part of the driver - the BEST way to make the roads safer. \r\n A person that blames the economy on using tickets to generate revenue, or who claims they were the victim of a "speed trap" (the NMA's favorite line) , or claims they didn't know how fast they were going, doesn't know the speed limit, but wasn't going faster than everyone else, is not taking responsibility for their driving. \r\n As Baretta used to say, "Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time".  The highway doesn't care if you knew the speed limit when you run off the road because you were going too fast. \r\n Speeding is a strict liability offense from a legal standpoint.  Take responsibility for your own actions.

I believe there is nothing wrong with a hug. I know why there are these rules,but it has nothing to do with 'hugging injuries'. If a person does not want a hug,just say so! If it is more than a hug,then you have a problem . I myself love hugs! I do not let everyone hug me. There are some people that I just do want touching me. This girl got suspended! What happened to the classmate that she hugged? Why don't schools go back to teaching education,and quit worrying about a hug!

All bud products are piss water.  Coors is the same.  That stuff isn't beer people, it's sold to morons like you who identify with the people you see in commercials during a football game. \r\n\r\nAmerica doesn't have real domestic beer.  They have piss water and everyone in the world should know that.  Bud makes it's money not off of beer they make it off of over advertising.  \r\n\r\nHeineken is a real beer.  It tastes like beer and only uses premium products.  They don't over advertise because they don't need to, the product speaks for itself.  \r\n\r\nBudweiser is for dumb rednecks who would drink anything you put in front of them.

I wouldn't. The camera  can capture any of us in an awkward moment. I was an elected official at one point in my life and in that nine years I was photographed drinking out of a two liter bottle of softdrink while sitting in my car, yawning, eyes closed, food falling out of my mouth, sneezing, going to the hardware store in my grubbies and straw in my hair. Oh yeah. Public life is fun.

Is anyone else feeling the absence of Bob's usual pairing?  This might be bringing Sandy home harder for me than any media report, while revealing my own drug-like dependency on his recommendations -- an exaggeration, of course, but I'm wishing our purveyor and his Manhattan peeps the swiftest and surest recovery.  Someone recently (was it Michael Chabon?) paid particular attention to the nastiness of soaked cardboard record sleeves, and somehow they've turned into one of the emblems of this ordeal for me.

This happened this past Wednesday, the 31st. The wife and yours truly, recently retired, brought back a Family Value Tradition, we went trick and treating. In these hard times, we just put on our everyday clothes, and went to have some fun. We went as a couple of "F.O.P.S". We had good intentions, until I knocked on the first door. When a younger lady who answered the door, and asked what we were dressed up as. The wife replied, " We are F.O.P.S." She remarked, "What?" Then I replied, "F.O.P.S", dear lady, "Flinging Old People" She slapped me. The moral of the story, that we went to Wal-Mart brought candy, and the "F.O.P.S." are no more.

Ah-ha! I see I wrote RT but I meant to type RTP. So many stalkers so little time. Yeah RTP is a creepy creepy little man. I always loved how he likes to use names and how he never wants anyone to forget MP. It was great when he would post under both of the characters and fight with himself. You could tell he just had everything written down and would cut and paste from a log he kept. I really do believe he has lured people to his home before. If you googled the address he kept posting it sticks out. It has red steps that lead to a red door. Can you say Gate's of Hell!

What most do not realize is that waiters and waitresses ARE making minimum wage.  The employers are required by law to make up the difference in pay if they do not meet the minimum wage when their tips are included. Ii know this because I do payroll.  If your empoyer is not paying you accordingly, turn them in.  As for tipping, nobody tips me for doing my job.  Wait staff make the choice to do that for a living.  They know tips are NOT mandatory and if they expect a tip, they better give good service.  I do agree in this case, that if you are spending 140.00 on a meal, don't complain that you can't tip because of your single status.

I don't worry about sea creatures, just my dive gear malfunctioning. Being underwater and seeing what's around takes away my fear. Sharks are my favorite animal and I've never had a problem diving with them,  but I do give them their space. Running into an irukandji or box jellyfish would definitely suck though. I'm glad this surfer doesn't resent the shark.

FYI to all the idiots that think highway MPG should be the same at any highway speed thats not how it works.  The faster you drive and the more you accelerate and hard acceleration especially the worse your gas mileage.  If you floor it from stop light to stop light first off youre just an idiot, but think about how much gas you are wasting just sitting there at the light (THUS THE E-ASSIST FEATURE ON GM VEHICLES SHUTTING THE CAR OFF WHILE YOU SIT AT LIGHTS.)  But the faster you drive the worse your gas mileage.  Your best gas mileage will come between 55 mph and 64 mph.  The EPS rates the highway at 65 mph.

There is a reason Budweiser used to be America's favorite beer, it used to taste good. Now it's like watered down piss. All the company cares about anymore is making low quality cheaper product and making big profits and the end result shows. Anheuser-Busch and Budweiser are the McDonalds of beer. There are dozens of other better beers out there, since I live in PA, i will stick with Yuengling, tastes better and cheaper.

We have a national crisis in NY, NJ, and Conn right now the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, and all you could think of is Chris Brown halloween costume. Get a life people.

I have several pairs, and yes a lot of them are ugly but they are very, very, warm and comfortable. They last forever even if they start looking raggedy. I have never had a pair of boots that last or even feel this comfortable. One thing I would recommend is for UGG to come down on their prices, hello things are hard enough with the way things are. Good Luck UGG

In my post from yesterday, I explained that the Dow had made a 47% retracement, well today it extended the retracement to 50%, on the nose, and turned around and fell, initiating the first day of Wave 5 downward (-174 points, Mini Dec Daily Chart).  The projected target is the 12,700-12,500 area.  The Dow is in a classic Elliott Wave formation performing to a T,  and Wave 5 is the final leg. Expect Monday to retrace upward somewhat because of the large drop, but it will eventually fall again. \r\n  \r\nCrude Oil remains a SELL; the front month, Dec Daily Chart fell 2.28 today as I pointed out in an earlier post.

I've worn Ugg's for years, not because they are "pretty" but because they are needed. Expensive a little bit, but you would go through 20 cheap boots compared to how long Ugg's last not to mention keep your toes warm......

In a press release, Decatur said it waited for "clarification" of documents from the IBEW "that implied a requirement of our employees to agree to union affiliation" while working in New York and New Jersey.\r\n\r\n"As we waited for clarification, we became aware that Seaside Heights received the assistance they needed from other sources," the statement says. "To be clear, at no time were our crews 'turned away' from the utility in Seaside Heights."\r\n\r\n---"we became aware that Seaside Heights received the assistance they needed from other sources"...UNION AFFILIATED SOURCES I am sure!

Not all flood-damaged cars are pariahs. You can still get a quality car if it has been cleaned and restored properly. That process includes removing the vehicle's interior, including seats; removing the carpet padding and replacing it; disinfecting the car; changing the seat foam and shampooing the carpet; greasing all electrical connections; and replacing any corroded wires or components.  End quote. \r\n  \r\nNo mention is made of water intrusion into the myriad of electrical components such as computers, window and seat motors, air bag sensors, etc. These failures will show up sooner or later, good luck staying ahead of the repairs. \r\n  \r\nIf you have any indiacation of water intrusion as high as the seats, walk, no, RUN away from the deal.

I always have a hard time reading your "reviews" of country music awards shows, Mr. Barnes.  It is blatantly obvious that you dislike country music and consider it beneath you.  Like ALL music, including hip-hop, jazz, pop, and rock, it has a cultural relevance and a history, regardless of your opinion, and should be treated with respect.  Great country music is about storytelling, not just about dogs, pick-ups, trains, whiskey, and 'Mama'.  And, by the way, pop, rock, hip-hop, and the like have ALL produced musical drivel as well which has become popular, but you wouldn't want those musical paragons to be judged by works like "Gangnam Style," would you?

I am a responsible pet owner, and I do not have children (nor do I plan to).  I have interacted my pets around people, so they are accustomed to them.  95% of the time, a mauling occurs from pets whose owners have no business owning an animal.  You are obviously missing the point, over, and over, again.  The dog JUMPED not attacked.  And quarantine was needed because of an overdue rabies shot - it is PROCEDURE.  Please don't EVER own a pet, you obviously have no right to do so.   Keep stating things like you would have "killed it yourself" or "break it's neck", there is a right way and a wrong way of voicing an opinion.  Maybe if you would have done so in a more appropriate manor this wouldn't be such as issue.  You have 44 people who thumbed you down, and 4 who thumbed you up...retrospect?

In 1988, I worked all over the USA with General Mills, Red Lobster and Olive Garden.\r\nThe only place we had a problem with the union was in NJ.\r\nWe istalled floors, at night, the surface needeed to be swept, prior.\r\nUnion workers worked from 7 a.m to 4.30, with 4 breaks?\r\nWe got to the site at 5pm, no clean surface, so we swept the floors our self.\r\nThe union was outside filming us and said that we took jobs away from the union workers.\r\nThey shot down the site for 3 days to figure out who should have swept the floor.\r\nIt cost General Mills over $75,000 , \r\nThe union is not needed anymore, except for the mob and the politicians that are running it.

Thumbs up to the hotel owner. I personally think they should put the race on the back burner for now. Let people try to get back on their feet first.

What happen to the "Country Music" I grew up with? Seriously the country singers today had to have had an up bringing of Country Music to be singing it and would think they know the true meaning of "Country Music" not this Jambo-Bambo Music that is going on in today's Country World. It must be a new world order from the writers in Country. Boo to you in your judgement of Country Music. Brad Paisely i believe still understands Country music due to the fact of his close friend Little Jimmy Dickens.

How did that old saying go? The wise man builds his house on the rock and the fool builds his on the sand.\r\n \r\nThe current solar cycle we are in is about to peak, as it was predicted back in the 1920-30s by the scientists of the day. So yes, global warming IS real. We flush our collective toilets into our water supply. We dump tons of toxins into the air, water and ground. We make and bury mountains of cheap crap that isn't designed to last, for the sake of "convenience", and to have the latest and greatest gazmos and gidgets. This is not good at all. But this really has little bearing on global warming. Because it's this man-made part that's completely bogus. Case in point is the fact that the temperatures on Mars are rising at a similar rate, yet to the best of my knowledge, there aren't any SUVs and coal fired power plants there. So, yeah. Lets clean up the place and find cleaner methods of providing the things and such that we need, and want. But lets not be stupid about it. And lets quit being a bunch of dumb@ss sheep... ~_o

The Lumberyard club .Where real men go for wood ...He likes 2 more years to be at age .But i can picture his face when he catches his first pair of mens mesh thongs in his mouth...

Sure, create more laws, or allow the system to work in a way that makes it harder for the average person to make it, enjoy life, and get ahead, or use their own ambition! As well as working it in a way that doesn't allow our kids to grow up any faster or become less independent, great idea! ( I am being sarcastic) Not to mention being allowed to do things in life that make you tougher and build character, i.e. being allowed to walk to a nearby gas station if your car runs out of gas along the highway if you chose to, instead of having to rely apon some AAA service, or calling up a friend and having to wait for him to have to take time out of his day to come to your rescue over that type of thing (nothing wrong with doing those things, but still). Sure, all, or many of the listed things that you could get your license suspended for aren't good behaviors, or the smartest thing to be doing, but is just adding more laws to try to fix every little thing to the point to where it makes us stupid and too reliant apon laws and government, and not enough apon our own common-sense and moral judgment, they way to go about it?

A few years from now when all the workers rights are abolished and there is no minimum wage you all we be asking "wow what happened to the unions"?  Workering class doesnt seem to realize that capitalism is not free enterprise but ideal that is strangeling workers.  When wages in the U.S. are the same as Chinas, then we will start bringing jobs back where they belong.  Making a good lioving is not good enough for these money mongels, they have to steal and rob the workers who made this great country.  Lets face it, the working class can get along very well without the rich capitalist, but the capitalist couldn't survive 1 day without workers-think about it.

Frankly, NYC looked pretty trashy before Sandy came through.  Shooting fashion shots amongst the rubble has a certain artsie flair.  It shows that you can live in a cesspool and still look good doing it.  It's refreshing to see something other than bag ladies and firemen among the fallen timbers in NYC.

I can't figure out the reasoningbehind a person's need to have naked pictures of themselves on their phone. Why would anyone do this? And if someone stupidly chooses to do this they should not be surprised when someone see them. People should realize you have NO guarantee of privacy when it comes to technology. The boys shouldn't have done what they did but she was stupid for thinking no one would look at her pics. She should be glad they didn't put them on the internet.

Love Unions! You can either be a no name human resource working "at will" with-out a contract or you can have a contractual agreement with a labor representative to back up that contract.  Contract is the key, which is why so many mortgage holders have been able to kick American home-owners to curb, literally. Through-out this most recent econmic down-turn, which class of workers do you think sucked up all your conservative tax dollars at the un-emplyment line, at-will or Union? Who do you think has been at the forefront of not moving your at-will jobs out of this country?

Hate to say it.. but there are lots of people out there who think that humans are the only animals that count. So they dont give a rats behined about a dog, or cat. This kind of stuff happens all the time way too often. The only reason this is being reported is to bring your emotions about. \r\n \r\nI have been to local shelter to adopt my two lil buds. I can tell you that the most, not all, but most of the workers there just do their job and dont worry about how it gets done. No pride or love of ones work means your going to make a mistake, and in these cases its the life of an animal that pays the price for their mistake. \r\n \r\nChange procedures in the shelters that kill. Donate to no kill shelters so they can take more animals.

Psyched out,  I know at least part of the story.  Not being able to pay interest on the national debt by 2014 was given to me by a senior U.S. senator.  Yes, Bush Jr's  lax administration allowed the investment bankers on Wall Street, the rating agencies, the insurance companies and the major mortgage bankers to collude and put us into this mess.   The country was in an economic depression when Obama was elected and still is.  After the fiscal cliff in 2013, I expect the unemployment numbers to match those of the Great Depression of 25%.  Of course, they won't report the real numbers.  The IMF has already told us the GDP will decrease about 3% if the Fiscal Cliff takes place.  Romney says he won't allow the Fiscal Cliff to take place; I have not heard Obama comment otherwise.  Obama's philosophy of growth is to allow the Fed to do what they want and hope that will work.  Too passive for me.  Obama's foreign policy is too timid as well.  Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make 4 to 6 atomic weapons.  We should have knocked out their capability 4 years ago.

Giuliana, you have no right judging someone else.  Judging others about pregnant at 16, I think you are jealous.  \r\nAlot of those 16 years give there kids up for adoption. Other could judge you.  Your husband makes good money.  If you have a child you should stay home and care for him.  But I'm sure you have a nanny taking care of him so you can return to work .

Ahahaha that's what you get for supporing another coutry's economy/companies. And before you jump up and say that they manufacture some in the SOuth, i'll go ahead and ask THOSE workers...How are those wages working out for ya'?  I was incredibly surprised when i traveled to Japan to see BAKERIES give $500 credit to owners of new Toyota or Honda cars there. But why would we do that here? WE live by the capitalism and we'll die by it...well regular folk anyway. Those with enough money to buy lots of lobbists they'll get funded, ie banks and insurance comapnies. Oh well, we can always go to Walmart to buy some cheap chatchy outfit and keep the boats from China humming down.

They burned because those specifc batteries have devistating reactions to water, especially if they are submurged. Obviously they can get wet but prolonged contact with large amounts of water causes a chemical reaction that is compairable to the force of a shot gun blast. We use similar batteries in my line of work and most companies wont even ship them.

While classic country fan (as witnessed from the negative comments below) are disappointed with the turn the genre has taken, it has also welcomed a whole group of new fans, who used to hate the twang and now welcome the crossover into pop/rock. Especially because pop music has been taken over by weak voiced autotuned teenagers and non-musical, crotch grabbing hip hop, and classic rock radio stations are disappearing from the radio dial. Current country is welcoming to all of the disenfranchised rock and roll fans. If you told me five years ago I'd not only WATCH the CMA's, but actually know who most of the artists are, I'd have called you crazy. I haven't switched entirely to country music on my radio dial, but I do know the cross over acts and enjoy some of their songs. That said, I'm still puzzled by TSwift's success. I guess autotune lives in the county genre as well.

This article is not the cure all, but, it does probably wake up a lot of people to the basic facts.  I agree with some of the posters here that stated, nobody cares more about your money, than you do.  Of course, many leeches out there, trying to persuade you into thinking you need to invest your money into their schemes, or funds. Look at some of the wealthiest people on the planet, that took the Berney Madoff ride.  Celebs and wealthy smart people were taken to the cleaners. Basic common sense can go a long way in investing for your own retirement. Get street smart would be one way, as well as investing in yourself, by trying to learn a little about investing. There will always be hurdles to overcome, but, a decent approach to investing 101 can play a big role in your retirement portfolio down the road.\r\n\r\n  Check with your employer to see if they offer a brokerage account in your 401 (k) plan. my company opened up a brokerage account in our 401 k plan 3 years ago, and I started to really study up myself. I took a huge hit in the 2007/08 debacle, as all my money was in mutual funds. I lost over half of my money in less than a year. Actually finally relented, and bailed at the wrong time. I am almost back to where i was, by doing my own stock investing. Gradually dumped the mutual funds, and in quality dividend paying stocks, of which I reinvest the dividends. Those dividends are free money for owning the stock, so take advantage of it, much like matching with your company match in the 401 k plans.  You will have to follow what's going on in your stocks from time to time, or maybe every week, like I do. I am into that kind of thing, so  I enjoy it.   Spread your investments into different sectors, do some research, and you might be more successful in reaching your goals. Also, learning to not live high on the hog is probably the best approach.\r\n\r\n  I have nearly doubled my investment in 3 years investing in a MLP. It's in the energy sector, pays "distributions", something like dividends, of which I keep racking up more reinvested shares. It's a 45 billion + company, that is firing on all cylinders.  It's about to distribute distributions in a couple of days, which for me, means another cha-ching. Can you guess the company??\r\n\r\n   Look into high yielding 4% and up companies here in the USA and abroad. Do be aware of the countries that tax your foreign dividends.   Energy stocks, drug stocks, BDC's, mREIT's, shipping companies, industrials, consumer staples, some banks, ..basically one or 2 stocks from different sectors.  Be your own boss in your retirement account, and you could be a happy camper down by the river in your 40' motor coach!..

I can't handle 4 more years of this. I'll roll the dice.

"we wonder if some parents would have been happy not to report this "trick" and simply take the spoils as part of the on candy." Does the BBC have editors? The writer doesn't go off on the guy who hands it out but implies the kids will all do cocaine later on in life and and goes on to attack that the innocent victims would take the drugs and use them?  What kind of scumbag writers do they have working for them? I'd fire this ****. He seem like he does it himself by the way this is written. Shame on the BBC and MSN for allowing suck a poorly writte, accusation filled article.

This had to have been by accident. I don't do this drug but I've heard it is rather expensive and for him to be passing it out just willy nilly to trick or treaters must have been expensive for him. Or else he was on a high and got carried away. Either way if it had been one of my children he had given it to, I would have kicked his **** and then called the police.  All of my experiences were just run of the mill, thank God. But that's what you get when you live in a small town, everyone knows everyone else....and your Grandfather is Chief of Police.

Happened similar during Katrina.  I was then a 19 year veteran firefighter. Since retired.   Because I was not in a firefighters union, I was told that I could not be deployed to New Orleans to help. I had requested twice to join the ff union and was never offered an application.   So in my place, two union firefighters with a combined experience of under 5 years were sent.  Along with 19 years, I have worked for 15 years as a building inspector and while I was a firefighter, worked 18 years in union construction.  Did not want experience I guess, but wanted only a ff union card.   Go figure.

They really don't protect worker safety when they force companies to keep unsafe workers. In the new workplace, I am not sure that protecting seniority is fair to younger and better equipped workers.

America has to be educated about what the rest of the world does!!  In third world countries children work!!  \r\nThey play when their work is done.  This is no different than the children in the 1800's when America was an agricultural nation, which most third world countries still are.  I have seen children work in sugar cane fields, cocao forests and even in city dumps to help the family pay their bills and live a pretty nice life I might add.\r\nThe main problem is that everyone who is naive in America thinks that the rest of the world should earn the same thing as if they were working here.  It can't work that way.  Economies are too far apart.  Just check the exchange rate for other nations' currency.  If all things were equal as these nuts would like, then in El Salvador you would have every doctor and lawyer lined up at the end of the day to shoot the people working in the fields and factories so they could take their place the next day.  Manual labor gets paid what their economy demands not what the US economy says it should be.

I would like to nominate Rose & Green Tiger as Posters of the Day!!!\r\n \r\nYou ladies have hit it dead on.\r\n \r\nI do have a question though. I have no way of knowing if your mothers are still living (mine has passed) but tell me please, if they are still living, how do you deal with their "when are you going to make me a GRANDMOTHER????" attitude? I told my mother over & over that I didn't want to raise a child the way I was raised (poor & insignificant) yet I heard this every 6 months (starting right after HS Graduation) until she passed-20 years later.\r\nDo your mothers do this? If so, how do you deal with it? It's still haunting me that I was treated as if being someones broodmare was the beat-all to end-all.\r\nAnd just for the record, I really do think women should have husbands (not just a piece of paper saying that they have a husband; Real, non-cheating husbands) before they breed. Some females don't even bother with the paper & they think they are doing something great.\r\n \r\nAnd for the men reading this, in case you're wondering, yes the non-cheating thing IS a two-way street.

Less than a week before the presidential election, Christie will host Obama in New Jersey to survey Sandy damage. The governor created a buzz after saying this week that he had no intention of bringing the GOP nominee to the Garden State to survey storm damage first-hand.Folks don’t know the situation here following the storm,” a Christie adviser told POLITICO when asked if the governor is unhappy with the GOP nominee \r\nChristie has been a frequent campaigner and fundraiser for Romney, appearing with him most recently in Ohio. Christie cancelled campaign appearances for Romney in Nevada that had been slated to occur on Tuesday after it was clear the storm was headed to his state. \r\nThe governor told Fox News that he has bigger things to worry about than the campaign. \r\n“I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,” he said when asked if Romney would visit. “I’ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that’s much bigger than presidential politics, and I could care less about any of that stuff.”

My Grandparents were married in England during the war. They returned to the states separately, my Grandfather flew home with elements of the 8th Army Air Corps and my Grandmother on a troop ship to the Brooklyn embarkation depot. Half way through the the voyage back home, my Grandmother was on deck with some of the other nurses from her unit. Before she knew it her wedding ring slipped off of her finger and 'bloop'...It disappeared into the black of the Mid-Atlantic ocean. Now fast forward to their 20th wedding anniversary. They were taking the big boat back to England, The Queen Mary. On the third night of the voyage my Grandparents were having dinner in the main dining salon. My Grandfather had a London Broil and my Grandmother ordered the Atlantic Salmon. About half way through the meal my Grandmother bit into something hard and broke a tooth. She deposited the object from her mouth and into her napkin and do you know what it was??? It was part of the fishes spine that didn't get romoved when the fileted the fish...Wouldn't that be crazy if it would have been her ring though?!?!?!\r\n \r\nI know this is an old joke but I thought I'd dust it off. Gotta do it once in a while. (**Rimshot**)

April. I think that you need to step back and shut your mouth.  You are defending a thief and a poor food server. That is ignorance.  As a waitress/er, the burden of YOUR customer meals being correct is on you. If the cook forgot something, then you better be sure that you take it upon yourself to correct it. If not, you have the same boss as the cook. The manager. Just because the waitress had to work on Mother's Day is on her. She chose the profession. Then to cop an attitude because the CUSTOMER said hey I didn't get my food. That is a disgrace to food servers every where. Not only that, but to change a good tip for poor service is STEALING. She deserved to lose her job, and HOPEFULLY she did. Imagine how many hard working people who got horrid service she changed their bill, but they never noticed. Your attacking the above poster shows how ignorant you truly are. Which is a shame. Also, working for your money and going out to eat with said monies surely does not make anyone an "over privileged b*tch" as you say. And before you try to attack anything that I have said. I have worked in the food industry.

Unions are just another flavor of democrats.   In unions there is NO incentive to work hard - you get the same pay if you work hard or are sleeping in the back of your truck.   Sounds great if you are lazy and like sleeping - sucks if you want to work hard and get promotions or higher pay for doing a better job.  Socialism = lazy=democrat.

I liked all the funny answers -- which I can't top --so I'll go with pointing out some possible factors to the idiot from MSN that asked such a silly question.  According to the source article, the "turtle graveyard" is in Northwest China.  That probably means the Gobi Desert, where a lot of interesting fossils have been found, but the story was pretty vague.  If it was the Gobi, unfortunately, the weather, altitude, inaccessibility, and for many years, the Chinese government itself has all helped make it difficult for anyone to explore for extended periods of time.  It's also a very, very large area. Then there's the issue of funding.  And chance.  The Leakeys had been searching for something like 30 years before they started finding the kind of significant proto-human skulls they hoped for. (Been awhile since I read about that, so I don't remember details precisely.) I don't know that anyone was particularly looking for fossil turtles in what is now the Gobi Desert, either, but I'm glad the researches are happy.

After the last "hurricaine" that hit the NYC area that turned out to be a whole lot of nothing I am not surprised that some folks were underprepared.  (remember last year, the one shot of a tiny wave lapping over a step or something?) \r\nAlso, how much gasoline can be stockpiled in an apartment in Brooklyn?\r\nLast thought- even if these folks had a 3 day supply of stuff to survive, it would have run out today- the hurricane was Monday.\r\nIf I were the employer of any of those people waiting that long to get on a bus to come to work, I would be damned impressed.

There have been many complaints about the current state of country music. Music evolves and changes based on what people buy. Pop music today isn't the same as it was in the 80s or 90s. Rock and Roll isn't the same as it was in the 80s and 90s. Why do people think that country music has to be the same as it was in the 80s and 90s? I love a lot of country music from the 80s, 90s and 2000s, but I still like a lot of the new music.\r\n \r\nIf you don't like the way country is now, listen to the country you like. Just because it changes, it doesn't mean you can't listen to the music you loved from the past.

OK, the truth of the mater is that most speed limits are established for political reasons not for engineering reasons.  If Mr. & Mrs. Smith and all their neighbors complain that the speed limit on their street is to high and someone is going to get hit, then the politicians lower the speed limit.  This is contrary to the laws that most states have adopted about the establishment of speed limits.  \r\n\r\nThose laws require that an engineering study be performed to establish a "resonable and proper" speed limit that takes into account: the prevailing speed of traffic, the amount of conflicts along the road (driveways, pedestrian crossings, etc.), whether there is parking along the street, whether there are bus stops along the street, etc.  In addition a speed study is done to determine what speed the "normal and reasonable" people are going BEFORE any speed signs ate installed.  When all these factors are considered then a speed limit is established that represents the speed that 85% of the motoring public is travelling BEFORE signs went up.  This results in a 15% violation rate which is something that is enforcable by the police.  When you have a higher violation rate then there is something wrong with the speed limit.  So, if speed limits are going to continue to be established for political expediancy, there will continue to be many violators of the arbitrary laws!  \r\n\r\nAnd remember, the 55MPH interstate speed was established during the oil embargo of the 70's for conservation purposes.  Traffic fatalities are lower now than anytime in the past what with safer cars, better drivers so I say heave-ho with those speed limits too.

Has the person who wrote this article or anyone referenced actually been to traffic court in the last 4 years?   Reason I ask is things have changed, budgets are tight and people are not getting reduced fines/charges for showing up in court.   In fact, I talked my son into fighting a ticket recently.  He appeared in court and the judge spent 5 to 10 minutes yelling at him for wasting the courts time and told him to go pay the 'damn' fine.  He told me that NOBODY got a break in the 2 hours he waited to be called.   I suggest the author  do some real research, i.e. spend some time in Traffic Courts around the country, and then rewrite this article for the year 2012.    Plus, add some stuff about ENTRAPMENT which has become rampant since the Depression hit us in 2008.  These cops are writing tickets to save their own jobs and they write them for ANYTHING!!!  I know three people who have gotten tickets for not using a blinker yet every time we threaten to reduce the force, they treat us to HOUSE INVASION commercials when the majority of them write traffic tickets.  It's become ridiculous and cops treat every person they pull over as a potential murderer.   Speeding is not a CRIMINAL offense yet they treat you like a criminal, just like the TSA.\r\n\r\nThe greatest generation didn't have to put up with these gestapo style cops and neither should we.

Like politics and healthcare, MUSIC has become a corporation. Its all about good marketing not good music. If you live in the south and have an accent...you write a song or sing...good or not, they call it country. Even if there is no resemblance of such. \r\n  \r\nI have been asking for a few years now WHY Taylor Swiift is winning Country Awards? Taking from those more deserving. I never got answers, so its nice to finally see others feel the same. \r\nJust cuz you live in the country, dont make you a country singer. YES Country Music has changed, evolved, but so much its sometimes unrecognizable. There are alot of really good Country artists still, they may have changed it up a bit...but the roots are there. \r\n  \r\nMusic in every genre has changed, a lot of NO-Talent being signed and its sad...for most its about the MUSIC...for others its about the money. Corporations have pretty much destroyed everything. Real talent is now few and far between. Get the pop singers outta Country and send them back where they belong.

Boy are you confused. Romney is a non christian cult member who thinks god is a 6'2" blue eyed deity on the planet KOLOB. Obama is a christian from a baptist congregation led by the Rev. Wright, who was not necessarily enamored with southern white culture from the 1960's.

Masquerade gay right as human or cvil rights,  reduce all voices that does not uplift their cause..put either homosexual closet people or sympethizer in places of power(law institution, boards of trustees, policy makers in every arena) to affect change for their SPECIAL INTEREST. eliminate the church voices and ultimately dismantle the church... as it is their biggest advisary. discredit the constitution, by calling it sub standard, or arkaic, not changing with man. As if their way of life is the future in this country. discrediting all who oppse gay marriage by calling then BIGOTS discriminatory views. Using the popular voice and pay them to speak on their behalf through commercial and entertainment playing field. The gay figure if they say it enough, well you will believe it. I can not be trick into the digusting thought that homosexuality isn't anything but perversion and demonic in nature. We need to tell the GAYS that America always operate with majority voting and they can't win with 2.8 percent of the population.LIke demons, they must find flamboyant ways to get other to vote for them. That is where the trickery come in. ARE YOUFALLING FOR THOSE LIES  and TRICKS?

How long do you thing gas prices will continue to fall?  Flip a coin.  We know in the Spring, Summer, and early Fall the price remain high because more people are on the roads.  The answer is when they need to make more record profits so they can pay their over paid CEO's.  They run a crooked monopoly that gets very little government oversight.  Romney, the clown wants to keep giving subsidies to the Koch Bros. and other oil behemoths.  They also need to regulate the Speculators who were deregulated by Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican.

Every time I've been stopped by cops, I'm always respectable and honest and a sense of humor is helpful too.  I've talked myself out of more situations than even I can believe!  I had traffic warrants and talked my way out of going to jail and just promised the officer I'd pay them, and I did.  I don't know about other states, but I generally find that California cops are usually pretty cool, such as LAPD, California Highwya Patrol, and Long Beach PD.  California Sheriff's, on the other hand, are a-holes.

I agree with you 99.9%  I do speed sometimes when I have a long distance to travel.  On the interstate I go no more than 5-7 over if traffic is thin.   I don't glog up the passing lane.  City traffic or heavy interstate traffic, I go the speed of everyone around me so I don't slow the flow of traffic.  Would you be inclined to give someone a ticket under those parameters?

Jeez, I agree country is not like it use to be. But music as a whole isn't like it use to be. If you don't like don't listen to it, simple as that. I'm not that old but, I like listening to the older country (reba, loretta, george, alan, etc). It was better & is def. easier to enjoy & listen to. But I'm sure years from now today's "country" will be considered "old" & will have changed again. Get use to the change because it's going to keep happening, but you don't have to like it. It would be great to have george, reba, alan performing at award shows again but it is what it is. Just think years from now, when today's generation is in their 50's, they will be wishing they still had luke bryan, jason aldean, blake/miranda, lady a, carrie & the rest. One thing though, Taylor swift def. needs to go. She cannot sing at all, what in the world are her "fans" thinking. She is one that I always have to turn the radio off when she comes on, her & lady A, idk why but the chick's voice from lady a irritates me. There are a few "country" artists that can't really sing, but just because country isn't the same as "back in the day" doesn't mean that the truly talented singers of today don't deserve to be recognized. Just my thought.

People should become aware that Today's Science is both Political & Corrupt. It's all about the Money. It's common for Tenured Scientists to pressure Non-tenured Scientists not to apply for certain grants. It interferes with their Agenda's. Less money for them. In some instances a non-tenured Scientists Career can be destroyed if he should persist. Basically your mainstream Science is in bed with the Politicians. Agenda's take precedence over good Science.\r\n\r\nI don't blanket accuse All Scientists. To be sure there are many trying to do their Job. Honest research looking for answers.  But be aware that their work is controlled by the Scientific hierarchy & the Politics. What doesn't fit the Agenda ends careers.\r\n\r\nStrait Up... I Don't believe in the Political Agenda of Global Warming as portrayed. It's 99% BS. The Climate has been gradually warming since the Last Ice Age, Else few of us would even be here today. Note also that All Climate Computer models gets a Fail. None of them fit the Hard physical data. Yet they use these models to promote their Agenda.\r\n\r\nAlso note that periodically, Hard Data would indicate were about to enter an Ice Age. We can only Hope it is another Mini-Ice Age as was in the middle ages. Most Life will cease to exist if it's a full Blown Ice Age. I would prefer the Warming. Most of which we could adapt to if it's for real.\r\n\r\nThat said, I would Encourage Climate Studies. Honest Research is good. As Stated, Warming we can deal with. Ice age not so much. Research may help us avoid an Ice age or at least minimize it in the Future. If we learn Enough.\r\n\r\nMoving away from Fossil fuels is Logical. We simply can't sustain our system with it. Especially if we want to grow. Eventually we would run out, but the real issue is supply can no longer keep up with demand hence the prices will continue increasing until we run out due to no one can afford it. The Consequences of which will lead to Major Wars possibly unleashing the Nuclear holocaust. Yes, Man really can affect the Climate. To the point all life becomes extinct.\r\n\r\nSo in My Conclusion, All this Global Warming BS should be swept aside & the Focus should be on developing Clean, Efficient, Cheap & Plentiful Energy for all. This can't be done if all our Financial resources are used to finance Political BS. The Money is running out. Opportunities will be lost.\r\n\r\nBe aware that Wind & Solar tho may be of benefit, It is not the answer. The 3 to 4 times cost factor is only half of it. What your Politicians don't tell you is To be feasible it will cost double that. Your Income will stay the same. This means Economic collapse & the vast Majority of the World will live in destitute poverty & Famine. The World at War Scenario. We need new technologies.\r\n\r\nIf Your a Die-hard Global Warming fan. What I suggest would alleviate your concerns. Otherwise we should prepare to move back into caves. At least those few who survive.

When I first move to D.C., I did not know what the "British Pub Rules" signs meant, posted outside of some establishments. When I tried to tip a waitress, she explained that the "rule" was "we pay our staff a decent wage, no tipping necessary". I was pleasently surprised.\r\n \r\nI found a few businesses, that used that practice, and ALL of them were GREAT places to visit and eat. At the end of the meal I could relax and not fret over !5%, @0%, etc.\r\n \r\nTo those businesses, I tip my hat.

I'm all for the movement to do away with public schools altogether. These days, they're little more than daylight-hour prisons for kids that did nothing wrong. It might be different if the children were actually being taught something, but that seems to be the exception rather than the rule anymore.\r\n\r\n My daughter was home-schooled, has graduated college, and is now doing quite well with her life.

Excuse me, but when you need help, any willing soul should be a welcome blessing. Reading this makes me sick to my stomach and creates great difficulty for me to feel sorry for their plight when conditions are attached to the aid they receive. They are in NO situation to be prideful or arrogant. If they were bleeding internally, would they only allow a union doctor to perform life-saving surgery?  Unions are worthless and cause more damage than good. So glad to live in Arizona, where this garbage isn't so prevalent.  Proverbs 16:18  Pride goes before destruction, and haughtiness before a fall.

I'm not a hugger and never have been. I think that most people like a hug every once in a while. We are a tactile species. But if you are not hugged when your a child, like I wasn't, you grow up not wanting to be touched unless you let the other person know it's alright. I think children should be allowed to hug but they need to realize that some children, like some adults, don't like to be hugged. But don't plant the seed of doubt that hugging is somehow wrong or dirty. Just teach them to respect the other persons right to not want to be hugged. And don't hug anyone when you are sick.

They also lied about the Sonata. \r\nI bought a 2012 in dec 2011 and have never gotten anywhere near their stated mileage. \r\nWhenever I questioned the Serivce Dept or their US HQ Customer Service, they danced around the subject and send it depends on the driver. \r\nWhen I pointed out my driving style is very conservative, then I was told I needed a 3 month breaking in period. When that was over, they once again tried to blame it on me. \r\nI only average around 25mpg and bought the car because my 10 yr old 6cly Nissan Max. averaged 20 and I wanted to get the higher rates. \r\nWhat a rip off.

Corollary from Sununu's comment is:  Sununu is voting for Romney because he is white.  That also explains why middle-aged white men are voting for Romney/Ryan even though they are going to be handed a voucher to buy private health insurance when they are 65!  Imagine trying to buy private health insurance when you are 65!

It is pretty obvious from your attitude that you deserved every ticket you have gotten. Here is wishing you many more.\r\n \r\nYes, I have gotten tickets, all of which I have deserved,  and I have also been let off with warnings. I have only encountered one cop in 54 years of driving who was hostile and even then I freely admitted I was wrong. I appealed and the violation was dismissed because I was not given a hearing within the requisite time limit.

A ticket can be issued by an officer attitude and not honesty,lots of  individuals are guilty of a traffic violation some are not, not  all officers are honest. I was returning home from breast cancer surgery,so \r\nmy husband was driving and my friends were recording the entire drive,we were stopped,he asked my husband to step out of the car,and put him in the patrol car, then returned and said he stopped us because he didnt see any seatbelts,but everyone was still strapped in. then he changed it and said,he mean the driver said he didnt have one on,which is my husband. I politely said my husband wore a seatbelt too,and would never say he didnt wear a seatbelt. He noticed the video cameras, and faked things off, and said just doing routine traffic checks, my husband returned to out car, and the officer left.\r\n \r\nThe entire incident was recorded,and he figured it out soon enough.  so ticket or not  not every law enforcement person is honest. Everything is about money. The get away with many crimes because no one suspect them.  Imagine that.

From what I see posted, my mother and grandmother were lasty. A hug was almost always a sign of< "Well Done." The men in my family weren't bashful about passing out a hug ever so often. My siblings have kids AND grandkids. When we get together, we get/give a hug. Of course I'm aware that my "little sister" would like to go into the back yard and "take me down" because I'm the only brother of hers that she has never "taken down".  When my mother-in-law turned 90, I gave her a hug. She looked at her daughter and asked if she could keep me because I gave "great hugs". Sincere affection and/or friendship should not be punished.

I have been a country fan since I was very young.  What they call "country" today IS NOT COUNTRY and where did COUNTRY WESTERN go.  I agree that Brad Paisley was "country" when he started, but like the rest, he too as gone pop.  Country means wearing jeans, a nice western shirt and a western hat.  NOT torn up blue jeans, t-shirts and caps.  I agree: Come back, George Strait, Reba, George Jones and show this new generation what "COUNTRY WESTERN" really should sound like!!!

A baggie might be fun for an adult, maybe even a teen, but for a small child it'd could potentially be a trip to the morgue.  I don't have any issue with adults doing whatever they want to their bodies, but this could have killed a child who didn't know any better.  Not funny in the least.

No, I want to see honest press coverage of the candidates. When candidates lie, and they both have, the press should step up. FOX doubles down on Romney / Ryan lies, and the rest of the media is selective about what they expose, but are somewhat balanced between both candidates.

I agree that this situation is difficult to accept and the responsibility falls to Mike Brown to turn it around. They have made a couple of great additions in Howard and Nash but it all gets down to chemistry and learning how to anticipate your team mate on the floor. Expectations have been sky high for this team since the SHowtime days and followed up with the Zen Master's championships. If this were Orlando we would not be hearing a peep.

The fact that Tesla won COTY has nothing to do with politics. It's a fantastic car that I happen to like a lot, but that still doesn't change the fact that these tax incentives for buying electric cars need to be killed.  Who should the tax payer offset the cost of some righ guys Tesla or Fisker?  Or even a lesser expensive Leaf and Volt?  If there is a demand, they will sell.\r\n \r\n(On the bright side, so far the Model S won't turn you into BBQ, so that's a plus.)

Team Romney Admits “Relief” Event Was Staged for Political Reasons \r\nI also found this part of the story fascinating. The Romney campaign admits that the intent behind the rally was swing state election visibility, not hurricane relief: \r\n \r\nBut Boston wasn’t quite ready to lose a full day of swing state visibility with a week left in the race. So, after some deliberation, the campaign decided to use their existing venue in Ohio to stage a makeshift, and nonpartisan, humanitarian project. It would be a way for Romney to show leadership — and get on the local news — without looking craven or opportunistic. \r\nThey weren’t willing to lose a day’s visibility in a swing state, so they came up with the event and crafted it in a way that would still get them political benefit, but would camouflage the intent.  So, as I predicted, Team Romney saw Hurricane Sandy – saw the imminent peril of tens of millions of Americans – as a political "oppotunity" to exploit.

THE KICKER I agree with you, teach your children to respect authority, but I don't send my kids to school to wash the cops car. That's the trustee's job. The cop had no right to ask him to do that. If you don't agree then you go to the police department in your community and tell them your there to wash their cars, instead of going to work tomorrow.

As for that outfit she wore, hope she threw that in the trash after she was done.

I have the books on a berm home and a place where one would be perfect. Remember those "70's" books on that sort of stuff, Re-Tog? They are worth a fortune now. I've been working on glass roof cultivation (in my spare time). Better investments than on Wall Street. Not trying to drop out but these things are gaining popularity and it could be subdivision type fun.

Hey - if you want to hear country........   look up bluelonesome.com or check them out on facebook.  They are pure country - not any of this stuff we heard last night.  If they are ever in your area, be sure to go see them.  They are GREAT!!!  I, like the rest of you I get tired of not having country music to listen to.  I would like to have heard Willie do Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain - but guess they would not give him the time.  The best song of the evening was when Carrie Underwood sang Connie Smith's song and Brad played the "acoustic" guitar.  That was good clear music and you could actually hear her sing!!

It's amazing how little you hear of the Bush legacy in these discussions.  It's amazing how little you hear of the Bush terms from the Romney campaign!  They're right to distance themselves.  There is no escaping the policies under Bush that nearly bankrupted this country: loosen financial regulations, start two wars, cut taxes, and increase Medicare with a prescription drug benefit.  Lunacy.  Google where we would be had we just not done the tax cuts in 2002!  Nowhere near where we are now in debt.  There would BE no crisis. \r\n  \r\nThe country was financially collapsing when Obama came into power.  He has done the best possible with what was left him and yes, it has taken years to mend and will probably require years more.  I thank God for his presidency.

I did not interpret this video to say anyone was going to hell for the way they vote. The Word of God says "Our God is a consuming fire" which means He burns away all impurities in His children....to reveal the beauty or "gold" that is there.That does not mean a condemnation to Hell tho. I think Huckabee means we can make choices now that will stand the test of time and of purity.  I do believe every choice we make can make a difference not only in our lifes but of others so we should take our privilege to vote seriously.

Chris seems to convey that it was some type of bad luck, an unkind twist of fate that brought him to his current situation. In the article  I did not detect any remorse for misdeeds, only that he has suffered a loss of  favor with his fans as a result. He wants to "rehabilitate" his image and recreate his previous success. How about his tendency to violence, personal assault, and respect for others?  Now there is where the "rehabilitation" should start.

In over 40 years of driving I never got a ticket for any moving violation because I tend to be a very careful and conservative driver.  My husband hates that about me!  Anyway,  for several years I took the same route to work and always took a right on an inner citty street in what I thought was a right turn lane.  Wrong!  One morning an officer pulled me over and should have known by the look on my face that I had absolutely no idea the lane I thought was for turns was actually a breakdown lane.  The sign was about 50 feet back and everyone always, always used it for a right turn. Apparently the city decided this intersection could be a cash cow for them and started stopping and ticketing people and I was one of the unlucky victims.  I was polite, apologized profusely and was obviously very embarassed about my faux pas but the jerk of a cop gave me a big old ticket anyway.  I went to court, explained to the magistrate about my perfect record and stupid but totally innocent mistake and the ticket was squashed.

"Meep Meep ...." \r\n  \r\nGood post VoxPopulae.  Funny! \r\n  \r\nDon't worry about Donald Trump.  He did just receive his lay-off notice from Martha Stewart. \r\n  \r\nHowever, he's just figured out that Curt Schilling owes him millions! \r\n  \r\nBack on topic, back in the day I owned Tanger Factory trust preferred stock I found on quantumonline, a web site for income-generating stocks.  I loved that dividend.  Some years ago, the wife and I were driving from Aurora, Missouri to Branson, Missouri and we passed a strip mall with a sign that said "Tanger Factory Outlet Mall."  What a hoot to actually see one of your investments out there in the boondocks making money for you. \r\n  \r\nAnyway, I got to get back to work holding a gun to the heads of these little kids picking cocoa beans. \r\n  \r\nI've read a lot of ranking of Cramer on his site.  He may be a wackadoodle, but if he is pumping Tanger Factory, this time . . . . he knows what the f___ he's talking about.  You heard it here from Ice Cold Sangria. \r\n  \r\nSo, we need to pick out a bar in Vegas where we can all meet Wednesday morning and toast the new President.  I recomment the Bacarrat Bar at Bellagio.

Government is secular but that doesn't mean you can't wear your Jesus t-shirt while you're voting.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the "government is secular" argument is far more meaningful if you use it to ban all politicians except avowed atheists, but even that is problematic because the Constitution doesn't say you can't be faithful, just that you can't tell others what god, gods, or no god at all they are allowed to have faith in.\r\n\r\nI can see the argument if she was wearing an Obama t-shirt or a Romney t-shirt.

Thank you for possibly implying that volcanoes may be more important at possibly causing our current problems than human activities of consuming fossil fuels.  It appears there are currently 20 active volcanoes worldwide, depending upon how you define a volcano.  http://www.volcano.s  ​ i.edu/faq/index.cfm?  ​ faq=03\r\nThe first thing that is interesting about volcanoes possibly being the source of our current problems is that they lower temperatures.  http://volcanoes.usg  ​ s.gov/hazards/gas/cl  ​ imate.php\r\nHowever, \r\nhttp://www.ncdc.noaa  ​ .gov/sotc/global/201  ​ 2/7\r\nreports the following for July of 2012:\r\n"Global Highlights\r\n    The average combined global land and ocean surface temperature for July 2012 was 0.62°C (1.12°F) above the 20th century average of 15.8°C (60.4°F). This is the fourth warmest July since records began in 1880.\r\n    The globally-averaged land surface temperature for July 2012 was the third warmest July on record, at 0.92°C (1.66°F) above average.\r\n    The Northern Hemisphere land surface temperature for July 2012 was the all-time warmest July on record, at 1.19°C (2.14°F) above average."\r\n"There continues to be efforts to reduce uncertainties and improve estimates of present-day global volcanic CO2 emissions, but there is little doubt among volcanic gas scientists that the anthropogenic CO2 emissions dwarf global volcanic CO2 emissions."  An interesting chart appears after the quoted material that appears to refute volcanoes being as significant as man concerning our present problems.  http://volcanoes.usg  ​ s.gov/hazards/gas/cl  ​ imate.php\r\nBy "googling": ocean temperatures relationship to hurricanes\r\nI was left with the impression from reading a few of the articles that there is a possible link between ocean temperatures and the development of hurricanes.  \r\nI admit I do not know what we can do to stop volcanoes, if factually they are the source of our current problems, which seems doubtful.  I stand by my post that suggests that if our current problems are related to the consumption of fossil fuels, what should we do about it?

If you read the source article, it's even worse in some regards than reported here. After the cop tased the kid, the kid fell over and blacked out. No one called for an ambulance. Once the child came to, the officer went with him to the restroom to help him get "cleaned up", then to the nurse's office. Once the parents arrived, the officer suggested then that the mom take the child to the doctor. So, the officer screws up, committing a violation of the first rule of weapons handling, then doesn't even bother to call for help when the kid blacked out. Wow. Why, again was he only suspended for 3 days?

This may not be pertinent, but do any of you realize that Africa is not  the same as the sissy's in the U.S.A.  Those people, when not chopping each others heads and arms off, actually expect their young children to go out and keep the goats from being eaten by lions.  I don't think they worry too much about the Fair Labor Standards Act, and many are happy to dearly receive any kind of sustenance to keep ones bellies full.  Perhaps Hershey's should just pull out and not hire anyone for anything and then we can send aid as people are starving in front of our lenses.  (P.S.-there are 10 year old kids here in the U.S. that get up in the morning and help milk the cows.  Isn't that a travesty and let's hear a collective liberal OMG and let's not eat any cheese ever again from Wisconsin or Michigan or Minnesota)!

Are you kidding me.  Do you not know like so many other Americans on here that we have a Capitolistic economic structure?  That means the President doesn't affect jobs and business. Unless the President hires govt workers or a maid for the white house he can't create a job! Can't tell companies to hire more, to hire Americans etc... If we stopped buying these corporations products who have bailed on American workers but still collect corporate welfare (which is our tax dollars!) they wouldn't pull this crap! I swear before long we won't have labor laws that were fought for by our past generations and the story will be about kids in Georgia.

Spiders dont bother me too much, except Black Widow's but I have a horrible irrational fear of sh!t that flies and has a stinger. I mean a spider...whap! Dead! But a pissed off bee or wasp....how do you deal with that? I mean a bee, when they sting you, they die. How pissed off would you have to be to want to inflict pain so friggen bad that you are willing to die to do so. Then, you take a wasp...They just look evil! you get too close and they turn around a stare at you....swing at one on holy crap....A friggen flying sewing machine. They will sting and sting until you knock it of and then they come back for more. I just walked by a doorway once that had a wasp nest in the corner, I just walked by that was all. The next thing I know is the little bastard fly's straight at me and stings me right directly on the eyeball! No sh!t it hurt! \r\n\r\nSpiders, whatever!

Oh my god, I was just thinking the same thing! What idiot just assumes that parents would be happy to get cocaine as "spoils" (as if taking your child trick-or-treating was some kind of "drudgery" that you had to endure and you needed "spoils" to bear it!), for taking their children trick-or-treating?!?  ​ ? Where the hell did you go to school for journalism?? It's as if you're saying that most parents are drug-sniffing, irresponsible morons who only care about what's in it for them!! And the comment that the children's experience "with this class A drug was postponed by at least a few years"---as if all their children were going to turn out to be drug users ANYWAY!! Wonder where the author of this article grew up??\r\n \r\nThe paper or whatever he writes for should kick him off the staff pronto for this senseless and stupid comment (heck, the whole ARTICLE).

We are not all Democrats nor are we all waiting for the government to come to our rescue.  We do not live in a hurricane-prone area so it's very hard to prepare for what happened.  Towns that never flood were overrun by swelling rivers.  People evacuated when they were instructed to, bought generators until there were no more, and stocked up on supplies to help get them through.  But we have no control over 2.6 million of us losing power, including over 50% of the gas stations in the state.  Everyone I know is minimizing their driving to conserve what gas they have.  Why are there so many haters out there?????

Penalizing these corporations under preexisting law isn't going to mitigate third world child labor, as at the end of the day, no one is held criminally culpable and when you turn a multibillion dollar profit, any fines are easily absorbed. Government has to abolish limited liability, first because our country is predicated on the belief that all individuals are created equal and should be treated as such under the law, and second because limited liability removes an inherent natural balance to the the free market, risk vs. reward. Only when victims of these atrocities gain the legal right to hold shareholders accountable for unlimited damages, will these corporations develop anything remotely close to a moral compass.

Three-part comment: \r\n\r\nPart 1 - Companies who want to sell stuff want their stuff to sound and look good to us.  They hire marketing departments to make their stuff sound and look good to us. \r\n\r\nThey hire lobbyists to help lawmakers determine what laws make it to the books. Lawmakers also control the purse-strings (directly or indirectly) of the agencies who oversee the application of laws, and supposedly penalize companies who don't comply.  (NOTE: there is a big difference between assessing a fine for non-compliance and actually having that fine paid - see 'coal-mining industry').   The fact that the EPA even had the budget to test a an auto maker's products is amazing, until you ask yourself: why doesn't the EPA test all the manufacturers for accuracy, and produce a ranking so we could all see who the biggest liars are (I don't know about you, but, when I have gotten into conversations about MPG stickers, the accepted belief is they are all inaccurate).  The EPA is not stupid: they know if they went after a domestic they could count on repurcussions, so they go after (arguably) one of the least-likely to give them too much grief: a non-Japanese foreign make. \r\n\r\nPart 2: I bought a new 2007 Hyundai Accent and owned it until a year ago, putting 115,000 miles on it commuting to and from work in the Seattle area. The car was rated at 27/32.  On regular gasoline I consistently got 29-30  combined.  With premium, and driving a little less aggressively than I normally would (shifting to a higher gear earlier) I experienced 34-35 consistently, with the exception of the first few tanks (during break-in). I only point this out because, based on my personal experience, I think the EPA could have picked a bigger target than Hyundai. Which leads me to ask: why Hyundai? Maybe the lobbyists for the other companies want their stuff to sound and look good to us!\r\n\r\nPart 3: I notice that my mileage and performance seem to suffer when ethanol is added to my gasoline, is it just me?  Why don't the MPG figures reflect that in their reporting?  Why can't I get a MPG rating for Premium fuel, regular fuel, and fuel with ethanol added?  Wouldn't that be the way to do it?  ( I know, the EPA ratings are 'averages').

iFone is a company that offers IP communication services, it doesn't sell cell phones or smartphones. Apple suited iFone first causing a lot of legal costs, now iFone suited Apple in retaliation.  \r\n  \r\nMexico has a population of 110 million, and it's the second major continental consumer of cell phones, it is also an important consumer of computers. If Apple pulls out for a tantrum as you suggest, It will make Samsung, Nokia, Sony-Ericsen and others very happy.

They might as well have found the 50 or so bodies and posed with them for her glamour shots!! I wouldn't have put it passed them!!!!!!! I bet if they had lost someone they would've taken a second or third thought about what they did!!!! People like these deserve nothing in this country!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ​ !

Denver, it is electioneering because Republicans in general are known for throwing the Bible down your throat.  I think most people have come to the same conclusion, and it is evident by the responses here, that the shirt is pro-republican.  Maybe she didn't mean it that way and maybe she did.  It doesn't matter.  The fact is that you can't wear something that can easily be construed as leaning towards any candidate or party.

Of course when I couldn't afford them, i didn't buy them, but I definitely won't wear 6 inch faux leather boots that not only hurt my feet but don't keep them warm. At my age, I'm chosing comfort over style. Especially when that style is dicated by some fashion freak that I could care less about their opinion of me and what's on my feet.

When I am wrong, I accept the penalty. The majority of officers are doing their job right. I have had one  occasion that I was pulled over for speeding that he made up the charges because I was from out of state and he knew that no one would travel 1200 miles for ticket. He admitted that I was below the speed limit when he pulled me over but claimed that I was 15 above before. I was only 3 miles out of town on a sight seeing drive.

I agree with ThatGuy.  Books give more details than movies do, and movies often deviate from the book-story.  If I had not read Dune I'd have not had a clue what the heck was going on when I saw the movie.  Just one example, of many.  Lucky for us that most filmmakers won't trash up the writer's story that badly.

I will tell you I had an 'emergency c-section' (puhleese) with my first and when we were in the operating room and the disgusting money hungry doctor, who was in a hurry to go golfing, was slicing into my body to yank my poor baby out of my abdomen (I was awake BTW) I told my husband that if he even thought about looking over that sheet I would f*cking kill him. A c-section is very unnatural, and not how babies are supposed to be born!! I don't blame him for being turned off!! I WAS TURNED OFF BY IT!!! \r\n \r\nAs a side note, I learned a very valuable lesson from that experience...f*ck those greedy a$$ OB's, f*ck that disgusting, disease infested hospital, and f*ck all the lies we women are told to make us fear a very natural process (you know, birth). I had my remaining children at home with a midwife. It was awesome, and when birth is done right and natural, you know, no drugs but the ones your body produces naturally when it is allowed (oxcytocin), with caring and supportive assistance, it doesn't scare the men. Think about that really hard for a minute....

Never... Once an Actor/Actress, Musician/Singer.... Come outs to endorse a party its almost a slap in their own face.... Money buys influence... They in turn have millions upon millions.... If a person allows themselves to be persuaded by a singers fame and then base their decision off of the singers decision, it shows a lack of character and strength within the person who allowed themselves to be persuaded...We all have our own opinions and beliefs.. Actors etc... Have also got to vote for their country.... It is best that they keep their beliefs to themselves though as they are hurting only themselves with their beliefs and their cause...... Look at Russell Crowe???? Everyone knows that once an actor stars in a Quinton Tarrantino film, that Actors carreer is now over..... Look at who he supported... He thinks Obama is the light and the future.... Obama's the darkness and the past.... Lucy Lui too....No one supports Hollywood anymore or the liberal media.... The media wont even do coverage on the Benghazi attacks.... No one in hollywood is speaking up over the attacks but are still talking about Obama.... I have made a vow to never support any person in hollywood who is for the destruction and affliction of my COUNTRY.... I once liked Madonna when I was like 8.... Then she went gay and so my support for her stopped....Hollywood  ​  is starting to get the picture as well about how Americans are feeling for them.... For the last 3 months, they have had the worst projected profits from Americans.... No one wants to watch their movies or listen to them anymore and its affecting their pockets.... Thats not such a bad thing.... Show your support for your country by not purchasing the things from Hollywood..... Hit them where it hurts the most.... Their pockets

The Fiscal Cliff will be a total disaster for our economy if Romney by the ignorant citizens, like the ones that are members of the Tea Party and rich moron Republicans, put the Flip-Flpo of Romney in charge of the white House. The Cliff will materialized if Romney secures anothe large tax cut for the rich, and many cuts to the middle class tax deductios, that will not balance the Budget! Then Romney will continue doing what he knows best as a millionare, that is getting his associates in Congress to allow more jobs outsourcing to China, India, and Mexico!  \r\n     \r\n    The big news today Oct 13, 2012, is that another Company in Illinois making sensors (SENSATA) for automobiles was closed a week ago, all personnel terminated ( FIRED) with no jobs because the Company presently owned by Bain Corporation decided to make a larger much larger profit by outsourcing the Company to China.  All equipment and assembly line of sensors work is now quickly outsourced to China! This is the sickness that has been killing us, our economy, and our working force for the last fourteen years , as you know it all began with Bush, Mitt Romney and the Bain Corporation, and many other Large Corporations in the USA. We better stop outsourcing our work to other countries now or we will die as a powerful country! I can't believe we still have the courage to blame Obama for the problems of lack of jobs in our USA for the last four years. Just give the citizens a brake, and stop making more lies of why the economy does not make good progress, to include the perversity of Congress a snake nest of Tea Party, and Republican members opposing every Jobs Bills that Obama proposes.  You need to know that from 2000 to 2008, during the  Bush years, 8.3 million customers service, and assembly jobs have been outsource to China, India, and Mexico! Mitt, you are a lost cause; you change your mind every time you get out of bed. You are very dangerous to the American people because we do not know for sure what you are going to do if accidentally you become president, with your liar side kick Ryan, you will take many position dealing in foreign policy, and will prove to be a killer for us, like Iraq and Afghanistan terrible wars nightmare. Citizens wake up, vote for Obama president on November 6, 2012 or earlier!

I'm happy with my discover card.  I get cash back every year and pay no interest because I pay my card off every month with the money I didn't use when I charged something.  What a convenience.  It's not rocket science.  Only buy with your credit card what you would buy with cash and keep the cash to pay off the credit card bill when it arrives.  It may not be much, but I get $50 to $75 back every year just for using my card to pay for my gas, groceries, and an occasionally some clothes or other necessities.  I don't care about building credit history or anything else.  Just the convenience of being able to buy things without first having to go get the cash is enough for me and the cash back reward is just more gravy on top!  It's not the credit card company's  fault if people miss use their credit cards.  I never did get it I guess.  I mean why shouldn't I spend more than can I afford?  Am I missing something?  What financially competent person would do something like that?  Oh, maybe Americans!  After all, our education system is a joke, ranked some where like 17th in the world and routinely turns young people loose on the economy that are mathematically challenged and functionally illiterate!

Why are men so bitter?  Women can be just as bitter because men expect to get laid if they pay for anything, including the 1st date it seems.  Back in the days when men married "down" women could not get jobs that paid anywhere compared to what the men got paid so yes of course the men married a woman and was expected to take care of her.  However, the woman was expected to maintain the home and children.  That sounds fair to me.  Today, women are able to do the same jobs as men although they still get paid less for the same job.  With the poor economy, it seems like women are being hired more often than more for higher paying jobs now, but maybe this is due to the company being able to pay less to hire the woman over the man.  Who knows?  Both sexes have the horrible stereotypes for a reason.  Yes, there are many freeloading women out there that just want a guy to pay for everything regardless if she makes good money or not.  And, there are the men out there that expect sex for anything they buy a woman, wanting her to stay at home with the kids while he is dipping into other goods.  But you cannot lump everyone into those stereotypes.  Fortunately, those traits are obvious in the first few dates.  In my experience, it seems like most men are intimidated and uncomfortable with women that have their **** together (good job, house, etc).  Dating is hard.

After the hyper-storm years or 04' & 05', the weather channel had a special program called "What If?" It chronicled a 'what if' storm event to impact New York City. Anyone remember that ? Kind of scary now that this prediction is a reality . To say, "oh-it's just a cat 1, it won't be bad" is fools thinking. Hurricane Wilma in 05' was a cat 1 and flooded 60 % of Key West, and the Keys, half of South Florida (some were miles from any coast line) & knocked power out for day's on end everywhere here. This storm, Sandy, was a wake up call for anyone living near our coast lines (West coast too).

This happens way too often at the shelters--education and training the staff goes a long way. So does just being organized and checking the paperwork and file more than once.  Can they read? This is inexcusable.  So sad, so very sad. It didn't have to happen if the people responsible just did their job  and checked and read the paper work,   You don't just euthanize a dog..you check the papers a couple of times and the file... and then you re-check it again....wonder if they were on cell phones or texting?  In a hurry?  \r\n I would be terminating employees right now. Starting at the top.  No apology or substitute dog can take the place of this little guy---I feel for the family-how sad, only 3 years old....

Got to agree with foofoo and 63, the best ways to beat tickets are to not get them in the first place. It's not hard to avoid driving illegally, unless you're all too devoid of decent social behavior from putting too much emphasis on getting to point B in a big hurry. I don't like taking forever getting some place either. But I practice good respectful driving, to other drivers and to road law. It's not rocket science, but it does take some behavioral modification for some people to adjust their agendas to include safe respectful driving. How you drive reflects greatly on how you treat other people in general. If you're rude in general, you'll be an ahole on the road too. Get off the road.

once and again you said dont spew what you don't know. Rhianna said it herself that nobody knows what happened and that media and people like yourself have taken it farther than it needed to go. Media hype can make a lot of thing worse and if you really look at that pic, she wasnt in as bad a shape as the media portrayed. Most of the puffiness was from crying.  She said in a RECENT interview that Chris was battered as well, but chose to not pursue charges. Stop judging, for his sin is no greater than yours. read your bible.

My husband does not have a college education but he has a job that he LOVES and he's an all around cheerful guy!  Try dating someone who hate his jobs and then comes home every day depressed and miserable.  I love that my husband doesn't blame the world for his problems and doesn't wait for someone else to bring him the perfect job or solutions.  My ex and my sister are like that and they are just constantly running the same hamster wheel everyday, going nowhere.

Country music has slowly died. Last night's show was nothing more than pop singers. Miranda jumping around on stage and screaming her stupid song,,,,,,just ridiculous! I miss the days of Loretta Lynn, Reba, Tanya Tucker, George Strait, Dolly Parton and Waylon Jennings.\r\n\r\nLast night's performances were just crap. Faith Hill needs to realize, that her time is over. She sounded terrible and looked emaciated!\r\n\r\nWon't watch next year......

As the old saying goes, "it ain't country, if country isn't there"! and it sure wasn't there!!  Put these singers in their own category, but not in country... they don't belong there!!  How would rap or any other category take it if "our country" were played in their category and considered rap or whatever?  Nada, no, out the door we would go!!!!  Come on Nashville...you can do much better than that!!

Hey MSN, where are these articles??? \r\n \r\nHere’s CBS’ latest release on Benghazi,       NOT FROM FOX; \r\n   "CBS News has released a clip of an interview by Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes on Sep. 12 with President Barack Obama that indicates Obama knew the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya was a premeditated terror attack–and suggests the White House later deceived the public by blaming protests against an anti-Islam video. CBS chose not to air the clip for over a month–but did air Obama’s attack on Romney that same night." \r\n  \r\n    "CBS News has learned that during the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, the Obama Administration did not convene its top interagency counterterrorism resource: the Counterterrorism Security Group, (CSG). \r\n   The CSG is the one group that’s supposed to know what resources every agency has. They know of multiple options and have the ability to coordinate counterterrorism assets across all the agencies,” a high-ranking government official told CBS News. “They were not allowed to do their job. They were not called upon.“

Obama:  "Obama envisions a $4 trillion bipartisan "grand bargain" of entitlement and tax reforms, spending cuts and tax increases on the wealthiest Americans to solve the country's long-term debt problem while averting a jarring year-end panoply of expiring tax cuts and defense and domestic spending reductions totaling $607 billion. Obama's last bid for a "grand bargain" was his failed secret talks with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, that collapsed in recriminations." \r\n  \r\nRomney: " Romney is dismissive of grand bargains and opposes tax hikes on the wealthy. He says that if elected, he wants Congress and Obama to delay any permanent solutions until after the inauguration in late January, and has suggested he would be open to fixing the problem with a series of separate bills." \r\n  \r\nObama at least has an approach.  Romney is just p*$$ing in the wind.

What I would like to know is why you can comment on mindless trivial crap like this and can't comment on the Ben'Ghazi cover up. I noticed that in your obama loving you have let some agency rationlize the murder of our people in Libya. Why no article on the USN SEALS comments on this cover up?

Not really, since women commit just as many acts of dometic violence, if not more, than men.  But the feminists don't want you to know that, so they make up statistics and whitewash it by saying that a woman can't "really" hurt a man.\r\n \r\nHere's a clue:  If you're in a relationship, and you strike, belittle, or threaten your partner in any way, you are an abuser.  If you restrict their social contacts, or deny them contact with others outside of the relationship, you are an abuser.  If you deny or restrict access to the family funds, you are an abuser.  If you destroy their personal property, or file false reports agaist them, or deny them access to their children without a written court order, you are an abuser.  \r\n \r\nIt isn't a one way street, and as soon as this country quits granting special privileges based on gender and starts prosecuting all criminals equally, regardless of sex, the better off everyone will be.

No they are not.  Most officers I know are against stupid gun-control laws.  I personally teach the CCW classes to civilians in my state. \r\n The NRA has a special division devoted entirely to supporting Law Enforcement.   \r\n It is only the Chief's of Police (a political job appointed by the liberal mayors) that "endorse" gun control legislation. \r\n Do some research before you spout.

Because the article is not completely false.  In fact the article is more true than not.  The Decatur company was given forms to fill out associating its employees with the union.  Until the forms were completed, the workers were prevented from working.  Not "Turned-Away" in a literal sense, though definitely hindered, if not outright prevented from doing work.  The inculsion of "Joe Wheeler" was the only real falsehood.  The use of the term "Turned-Away" is simply semantics, not true vs false.

I'm originally  from Australia and  started wearing UGG's in the Summer "72" when we moved to Cottesloe Beach (Surfies always wore them) they kept your feet cool and stopped them  from sweating in the heat, you can still get them at the woolstores and surf shops $50-$100 for no embellishing calf height or the ankle sizes around $30.  This is pure Merino Wool, which is what they were originally made with.  They will always be part of Australia and the surf culture.

No wonder kids are so mean.  They aren't allow to show affection or friendship by hugging someone.  But then there is a lot of bullying going on, and they do nothing about it.  Kids don't know how to be affectionate, because of a few adults, that think it is wrong to show affection to another human being.  It's no wonder we have so many mean kids in the world today!!!!

My heart goes out to this family for their loss.  A free adoption would never begin to repair the damage done by such unprofessionalism and obvious carelessness.  Word should be put out around that area so that others are aware of the dangers of taking their pets to that vet.   My boys, ages 12, 8 & 1, are never left overnight at my vet.  Of course, they are a small town clinic, so I don't expect this would happen.

NEVER had a tenth the talent of Brian or Carl let alone the Fab Four...all this proves is you had the better lawyer. You missed the WHOLE POINT of what made those tunes great. Legal and PHYSICAL intimidation only go so far--the people KNOW whats what and no matter where you stage your next photo-op (borrowed house et al) IT STILL MAKES YOU A POSER! What did they do...move your mike a foot the wrong way? Too many brown M&Ms???You are a living tribute to what killed the music: greed, lawyers and delusions of grandeur. Will never buy anything YOU are on and WILL BUY everything or ANYTHING Brian puts out. Save your ill-gotten gains for some hair or maybe session players to approximate the BBs sound...someone will buy without reading the liner notes. Don't forget the disclaimor that your lawyer asks for! LOL I agree with RnR Johnny: "BOYCOTT THE SHOWS"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ​ !!!!!! Brian and AL should go on tour and without this HACK-POSER!!!

I never want to think that such a moron & a bully is to whom my safety or that of my neighbors is entrusted. He should be terminated immediately and without any of the benefits the deserving public servants get. I took a pepper spray class  ( as was required by LAPD to carry it)years ago that provided me with more caution and knowledge about that than this trained, armed officer demonstrated. That it happened to a child makes it that much more frightening.

on another note...Women can now stop making money from men. Child support laws need to be changed. too many women sleep around, getting pregnant on purpose to draw child support checks. I don't believe any woman should be entitled to child support unless she was married to the guy. Legally speaking, without a marriage contract, the guy never said he would support a woman in any way if he slept with a woman and got her pregant. If I were a guy, I would fight to change these child support laws!!!

Quote "he doesnt have a leg to stand on in this case"..I would argue the opposite since only one leg was amputated he has a perfectly good one to stand on. That besides he should be grateful that god did not take a rib to cure his wife (or an arm). These types of medical procedures usually cost an arm and a leg. He's still got two arms.

If a woman who makes good, chooses a guy who earns less -- she is going to be in it for the sex,  Idon't think she should marry the guy.  Just go for the ride and make it last for as long as it s enjoyable and it feels like love,  then when it sours end it and don't look back, unless the woman is one of those who thinks she can change him...she needs to be ready for another disappointment

Hey grasshopper, will GM be able to pay back the $50billion Obummer gave to the United Auto Worker's union in GM's name?  Will GM or the UAL or Obummer ever restore the Billions of pension dollars lost by retired people when the GM bonds were devalued?  Probably not because that would require Obummer to admit he made a colossal mistake, and Obummer never accepts criticism nor admits mistakes !

I've given 10% or even 5% for extra bad service.  I've received a salad with about 1/4 ince of icewater in the bottom,(servers dish out the salads).  I've ordered a country fried steak and received 2 plain grilled chicken breasts, with the server saying she wrote down the correct order, but accidently marked the wrong box for the kitchen.  She actually showed me the pad.  I ordered a patty melt and got a ham and egg melt.  The server told me she always gave people that who ordered a patty melt because "that's what they really want".  \r\n  \r\nI've given up to 25% + for excellent service.  I've even emailed the restaurant's home office praising several servers.  And I've seen parents with children make a HUGE mess and then stiff the servers.  I usually give a little extra then, if we share the same server  Was this $140 fpr ONE diner?  Did she have the kids with her?

I know its not a true scentific survey but I have only met one woman that hasn't gotten out of a ticket once in her life and she had received only one ticket. This question has ben posed to 100's of women thru work, friendships, relationships, etc. Of my male friend group of 50+ friends asked. 2 out of the 50 have gotten out of tickets. One registration and one speeding. So true its a small sample but Gary speaks the truth in my world. Even page said "I can count on one hand".....well 48 of my 50 male friends including myself could count on zero hands. And my 2 lucky friends can count on one finger. We are in Southern California btw.

Speaking as someone who comes from Ghana, I cannot say I am angry with Hershey or any other chocolate producer at all. Have any of these people involved in filing suit against Hershey ever been to a farm in a developing country? Most farms in developing countries are small scale and family owned. Adults in the family pass on the farming skills to the younger generation by involving them in the daily farming activities. Schools are not as readily accessible as in developed countries. I am not making excuses for Hershey but it would be extremely difficult for Hershey to find different sources of cocoa from commercial farms in such high quantities as it takes years for cocoa trees to grow to maturity. As the article said, 70% of all cocoa is grown in Ghana and the Ivory Coast and I am sure it is not that easy to find new sources even from significant producers like Brazil and Indonesia who slash and burn rainforests to cultivate cocoa plantations, which is not good for the environment. Also, small scale cocoa farmers would have to change their practices which will require monitoring and training which would most likely increase the price of cocoa. Are you all willing to pay more for your chocolate, even though most chocolate these days only contains a small amount of actual cocoa? Changing practices for these farmers would also require a change in culture which we all know does not happen overnight especially to illiterate people. If Hershey thinks by 2020 the cocoa it plans to purchase will be certified, I think we should give them a chance to pursue that goal.

I own Hershey stock but cannot eat any chocoate because it contains the prime kidney stone chemical calcium oxylate.  (The rate of kidney stone cases has about tripled in the last decade, possibly due to the jump in chocolate eating by Americans.)  Milton was a good guy, and that's what made me buy HSY stock.  And, hand chocolate out last night on Halloween.  And I own oil stock, which doesn't stop me from gagging at every BP ad!   I should have put a casket on my front lawn with Milton Hershey rolling over in it!

Their prediction was very vague.  There had already been a terrorist attack on the trade center in 1993 and there was talk in the news that it would happen again and at least a one or two people who were NOT psychic who predicted a plane would be flown into the WTC - which is more detail than the twins gave.  I think if you give non-specific predictions like this, you're bound to get a few hits.

I worry about jellyfish or other creatures that sting, while just wading in the shallow water.  If I went swimming in the ocean, I would definately worry about sharks!  In fact I wouldn't go out in the water because the risk is too great, as all these kinds of stories prove. It is foolish and doesn't show respect for life when someone ignores the reality of dangerous activities, especially unnecessary ones.  (Surfing is not necessary like driving to work is (because you may think, "so is driving a car, you could crash and die").

Social Security states that in order to be disabled, you need to have a disabling condition that is expected to last 12 month or end in death.  If you have no health insurance, I'm sure you could visit an emergency room for treatment.  When you apply for disability, they are going to ask you for a list of doctors, hospitals, and/or clinic that have seen you because they are going to attempt to obtain medical records from them if you don't already have them.  If additional medical evidence is needed for a determination, you will be sent to consultative examination(s) that the agency will pay for in order to get more evidence of your alleged disability.

Even with these re-rating adjustments, the new numbers probably still won't be accurate.  After reading numerous magazine tests over the years, I've seen real-world tested fuel economy all over the map versus the EPA estimates for the individual vehicles.  In mixed driving, few vehicles test right at the EPA combined estimate, others don't even reach the city numbers while some approach the highway numbers (mainly diesels). \r\n  \r\nProof positive that the EPA labels are virtually worthless for comparison purposes.

I don't think that these places have proper checks and rechecks in place so these types of tragic accidents don't happen. Maybe like hospitals there should be snap on information collars in place to identify the animal, why he is there and other facts including med. data. This information would then be with the animal whereever they move it......I know they meant well offering the owner another dog, but that would be offensive to me, kinda like offering me another kid if my child died.........

Did you know the pastor that POTUS chose to do his inaugural benediction in 2008 has stated that he hates white people and all white people are going to Hell?  True.  Can anything be more racist than that, short of violence?    POTUS is not poor, he is considered rich, yet he has a brother who lives in extreme poverty in Africa.   Can anyone relate less to the poor than that??   POTUS is way out of touch with regular folks.  At least Mitt has worked and volunteered in Africa to help those in need and has probably done a lot more than that to help others.

I was a union worker for 34 years and like everything else it has its good and bad.It protects everyone, the hard workers and also the lazy good for nothings. Big companys hire and fire on whims, the union protects you from revenge firings and etc. I was a victim of hurricane Rita and Ike,sustaning large amounts of damage in both. We thanked and fed all the workers who came and helped us in Southeast Tx. We didn`t care if they were union or not, just wanted them to get the power back on so we could start rebuilding our places and get food and services running again. I thank all the workers who  helped. Fema did a great job down there too, those people were great, I saw some take money out of their own pockets to help some of the worst hit.

Yes, Halloween DOES bring out monsters.

I've been saying the same thing about Obama for the last 3 years.  I think history may prove me correct!  How do you destroy a nation?  Pile up massive amounts of debt.  Start handing out more and more freebies and make the people dependent on them.  Start up class warfare and attack job creators.  Setup regulations that make it much harder to create a buisness.  Increase the cost of doing buisness (e.g. obamacare costs).\r\n \r\nYup if I wanted to destroy a country that's how I would go about it.  The key being that you have to increase the debt to a high level of gdp and combine that with anti-buisness policies.  Now the only thing Obama needs is another recession...that should pretty much finish this country off.  And recessions occur around every 5+ years so we are due for one in a year or so.

Not by using the dumbing-down of ignorant Americans by propagandist FOX/Fag Beck/Fat hipocrate Limbaugh. \r\n  \r\nI want to return to a strong independent American lifestyle and it won't happen with Romney (now that he is pandering to the extreme right) or Obama.

How long did it take to recover from the Great Depression? Classic, it took almost 30 years and a world war to get it behind us. Obama has cleared us from the Bush Depression in only one term. I say give him 8 more and thank him for the tremendous job he has done keeping the lights on for you.

My experience with a 1998 F-150 and a 2003 Lexus IS 300 is that both of them get quite close to the EPA numbers (actually a mile or two better) IFF one keeps a steady foot and drives the posted limits.  Add 10mph to the posted limits & both vehicles drop below the EPA numbers. (And they're both fun to drive fast, especially the IS-300)

Just because the word "Vote" is on her shirt is NO reason to keep her from voting.  \r\n The Supreme Court has ruled that whatever is written on a shirt is considered "speech" and is therefore protected by the 1st amendment. That is why you can wear the American flag on the seat of your blue jeans. Freedom of Speech. You may not like it - but it is protected speech. \r\n Electionering laws were meant to stop people from bothering others that showed up to vote by handing out "Vote for ....." flyers at the polls. The key word there is HANDING out. \r\n The fact that she had "Vote the Bible" on her T shirt would not even influence my vote one bit. But the time I vote - I have already read the material and decided on the candidate or propositions.

I was born and raised in Utah (56).  I am not a Mormon, nor have I ever been a Mormon.  The Mormon “culture” definitely shaped who I became and it definitely shaped the men that crossed my path.  I read “Fascinating Womanhood” when I was a kid, and took it as the gospel truth.  I have never been married, but I have had domestic boyfriends.  For nine years I listened to a guy that told me constantly; “when are you going to remember you are just a woman?”  I have been “smacked around” more times than I care to admit to because I would not “mind” or “listen” to the Lord and Master of the Kingdom.  So YES!!! Some of us gals are too submissive and passive for our own good and have really poor taste in men.  Thus the reason I have never been married.  The Mormon culture likes their women subservient, sometimes too much so.

No.  The consensus view of science is not that global warming has come to an end.  You're repeating nonsense from politically driven journalists that is repeated by political bloggers.\r\n\r\nHere's the article from the JOURNALIST (not scientist) who misrepresented the science:\r\n \r\nhttp://www.dailymail  ​ .co.uk/sciencetech/a  ​ rticle-2217286/Globa  ​ l-warming-stopped-16  ​ -years-ago-reveals-M  ​ et-Office-report-qui  ​ etly-released--chart  ​ -prove-it.html\r\n\r\n \r\nThe Met office (national weather service for the UK) whose data Rose abused disagrees with his assessment: \r\n http://metofficenews  ​ .wordpress.com/2012/  ​ 10/14/met-office-in-  ​ the-media-14-october  ​ -2012/\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nHere’s a rebuttal : http://www.guardian.  ​ co.uk/environment/20  ​ 12/oct/16/daily-mail  ​ -global-warming-stop  ​ ped-wrong\r\n\r\nIn any case, it is NOT "the scientists" who say that global warming has stopped.

If people read the actual article it states that "Her "pregnancy" police said, was part of the costume.". So she's not really pregnant. But in my personal opinion it is never OK for pregnant women to drink despite the fact that many doctors say a couple of drinks is OK.

Zillow is completely useless. Why anyone would trust a valuation from this site is beyond me.\r\nIn my neighborhood one home was completely rebuilt but never changed hands while another is in its original 1960's condition but recently sold. Zillow has the older home worth three times as much as the new home. It simply cannot be even remotely accurate.

Of course the human species would be extinct.  It takes a certain degree of insanity to want to go through pain like that and then do it again.  If this involved men all it would take is one time and that would be the end of it.  Heck, if a man saw another man go through that pain it would be off to get a vascectomy.

Gene Hackman is one of my favorite actors and at 82 he's had a bicycle accident and I know what it's like to be confronted by strangers or acquaintances.  I was over 65 when a stranger rushed me, mistaking me for some two legged street dog demanding money; he got a punch in but I got him back, big time...by the time the cops got there the bum had a broken nose and hand.  A thick leather glove wrapped around a nickel roll does wonders--the old hammer fist.   He went down quick.  My grandpa showed me how to get even with junior h.s.bullies who are physical.  Ambush them from behind at the lunch table and pull them backwards to the turf.

Another thing that Ethanol does is rots the rubber lines, corrodes metal tanks and causes more water to condensate in the tanks and all that adds up to a lot of money to correct. I'm glad that I have a station close buy that sells 100% gas for the same price as the Ethanol junk. \r\n TTFN101: Cars now are not like the cars of yesteryear where they were tuned for 55.

YES! Where were they going to stay, when the hotels have opened their doors to survivors? Where were they going to eat, when groceries are needed to replace food that has spoiled. Where were they going to get water, when bottled water is needed for those whose water is shut off or contaminated? Where were they going to get the gasoline, when New Yorkers are lined up for hours for enough gas to get to work? Where were they going to get police and EMT assistance from, when police and emergency techs are needed downtown? I have an idea: you marathon runners are in great shape -- how about you volunteer to help with the recovery?

Tell your friends about this repuke dunce.\r\nEverything lyin Willardo feeds his braindead followers is a myth. I am sure he would be doing better if he told these repuke dopes that he would create 50 million jobs in the next 4 years. They don't need to be told how.\r\n \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo should not even be running for president. But for a lyin moron, talk is cheap. This clueless moron has no idea how to fix anything. This criminal repuke bankupts companies and loses jobs. What a joke. The nuts that follow him actually believe that he is going to create 12 million new jobs and these dopes believe him. He does not have to tell them how, that does not matter.\r\n \r\nClueless Lyin Willardo is known as the slapped axx Mexican Mormon Moron for good reason. This complete dunce made himself look even more ignorant than he already is by stating in a campaign clip that if he ever overpaid his taxes, he does not deserve to be your president. Well this repuke dunce overpaid his 2011 taxes by $3,000 to make it look like he was paying a higher tax rate-which he can recover after the election. He has up to 3 years to refile an amended return. Only a pathetic, psychotic, braindead radical right wing cracked teanut dope will vote for him.

Hmmmm, as a man, both a concept I never heard of, and I (as a person, not a man) find the idea of marrying up kind of...insulting. No wonder there are so many divorces.  \r\n  \r\nThinking about it more, I am sure it occurs (by men, and women)...but I would think the recent data shows that more women are getting higher educations, and going into the job market. Not that men are marrying up.

We owned a service station during the gas shortage. Rationing gas to 10 gal per purchace. It always amazed me that once the gas prices were jacked up to what they wanted how gasoline went from short supply to readily available in any amount. From one day at only 10 gal to the next 10,000 gal. If you wanted it. During the shortage The port's along the Mississippi river were lined with barges filled with gasoline wating on the prices to get up to the level the companys wanted when they reached the level then they were unloaded and gas was plentiful again. Oh and gas was 32 cents a gallon back then gasoline not ethanol.

It is all a stupid game.  I was pulled over for doing 31 in a 20--but I was polite and the officer let me off with a warning.  I was sitting in front of a sign which said "Speed Limit 35"  but apparently 100 feet behind me I was still in the 20 mph zone.  I started to accelerate when I saw the new sign, but apparently that was too soon. \r\n The officer did tell me if I got a ticket it would be a 6 point moving violation.  Since I have been driving 30 years without any points on my license, I would suggest that was a bit draconian.  It is all a gimmick to raise money for municipalities and make insurance companies money. \r\n If I had protested to the officer, instead of groveling, I would be hundreds of dollars poorer now.  The system is rigged against those who speak their minds and defend their rights.

I bought a home and it was an undisclosed meth lab.  I started having headaches and hot rashes.  When the weather cooled and windows closed, started getting sick-I thought I had the flu.  Kept getting worse and worse and ended up in the hospital for 7 transfusions.  My blood counts were so low that I was 2 days away from dying.  Went to a hematologist for 2 years and had iron therapy and constant blood tests.  Didn't find out about the meth lab until I moved out and was fixing up for sale.  Contractor noticed some paint "crackling" which I thought was because it was an old house.  It was too late to do anything about it, to get a refund either from the former owners or the inspector.   Before I bought it, the house was inspected and no problems were found.  So..it you buy a house and have sudden unexplained health problems of any kind, do some environmental tests before it's too late.

The company paid 100% of our health plan, vision, dental.  Profit sharing, 401K, paid vacation..  The things a real company with good workers would do. Not because it was forced to, but because the owner wanted to keep the employees.  \r\n As far as equivalent pay scale goes.. I have no idea.  I do know that when I was an 18 year old in the union that had no idea what I was doing, yet getting paid nearly $30/hour,  I couldn't believe what a deal I was getting. \r\n Would I love getting paid $10 more dollars and hour while doing much less work? Sure. But that's not what I believe will actually get things accomplished.

Shelters are dreadfully understaffed, workers and volunteers are overworked and under-rewarded.  Millions of animals are given a second chance thru shelters, but we only hear about when things go very wrong.  This is a great tragedy for all involved, but filing suit against the shelter will only reduce funds for future animal care and likely increase the already high numbers of euthenized animals.

Koo,  Whatever gave you the notion that I was in favor of the GOP?  I believe that both parties protect the fed, which has for (how many decades?) brought us further and further into debt!  We cannot pay debt with debt!  We need a monetary system that creates money as an evidence of wealth to the people!   Everything is driven by money, and if that monetary system isn't honest, it has to collapse sooner or later. There will come a time when just servicing the interest on debt will surpass total gross consumer income.  At that time, or before, people will have to choose between paying their taxes or feeding their families.  When that choice is made, the markets will crash.  What's invested there?  IRA's, 401K's, pension plans, etc..  I think you can get the picture.\r\n \r\nV_L,  I think you have the idea that my proposed solution is wrong.  Please elaborate.  If we study what a lot of people tout as a money with backing, we harken back to the days when people thought gold and silver backed our dollars.\r\nIf you really think about it, those commodities never really backed our dollars.  Gold and silver in the ground are worth nothing, until man's labor brings that resource out of the ground and gives it value.  It was, and still is man's productivity that backed/s our dollars.  The difference between back then and now is that back then it was man's current productivity that backed our dollars. His labors were rewarded by having his gold stamped into coin free of charge, with no debt or interest involved. \r\nToday our dollars are still backed by productivity, but it is our future productivity, because all money is created through interest bearing loans and other debt instruments.\r\n \r\nOf course the banks will be closed before too many years pass.  My fear is that they will start up the same ponzi system all over again.

At 15, I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Aerosmith as my first concert ever in late 1977. They were awful. Never having seen a live concert before, even I could tell that something was not right. Flat, screaming into mics, the crowd was not into it at all. It was no surprise when reports came out later that they were stoned out of their gourds. I vowed then never to waste my money on another Aerosmith show ever again, which is unfortunate, as they have rebounded a lot over the years. \r\n\r\nThank goodness, my second show, Rush- A Farewell to Kings, was spectacular.

So Da Balls has all the answers again. What do you think all mine, yours and others social security deductions pays for...it's a pyramid scheme of schemes.  \r\nIf we don't earn enough money to save for retirement because the Repubes got lobbiest in there to deregulate most all, so now our cost of living is just barely under what our wage is, our 401k's have been wiped...ALL because of what...? If union labor is so expensive to Corporate America then why are there so many million and billionaires even now?  Most people who are against unions are retired, maybe sit on their butts types wishing they had gone a union job route so they would of had some kind of benefits that their non-union millionaire or billionaire boss refused to pay for...this is why unions got started in the first place, workers were dying on the job because bosses locked certain doors and fire escapes, knowing there'd always be some desperate person willing to fill the shoes of a lost worker. Greed and green envy.

Very true. And while I said rush some, still want to do the testing they need to to make it work, for reason like you listed with the experience in Utah. And yes I've seen that done before. Poor man's fix on a concrete highway. People can do it to their driveways too. Overlays like that are very suspect and have to be done right or else the chance of a premature failure is very high. Not alot of room for error with these. Better to just overlay with asphalt using the concrete as a good solid base or rip out and replace with new concrete. My thoughts there. :)

It's hard to sue an animal shelter as they hardly have enough to make it. Shelter's are quick to euthanize animals. This is happened more often. They do not care about animals. They only want to make room for more to come in and not look bad for not accepting them. \r\n  \r\nI don't know how I would handle it. I think I would sue the person that took the dog to the shelter.

Obama can only do (or undo) so much, Sir. \r\nWhat I recommend is, if one of those nefarious Tea Party types is from your district, you and all your peers, workers, neighbors and community groups must unseat them immediately.   The lack of any positive fiscal movements results directly from a cadre of Do Nothings with their favored agenda, to unseat the current POTUS.  Regardless of policy or ideological differences, we have never had a CONgress brought this low (for proof, check on Congress popularity ratings) until the TP'ers were voted in with their hidden agenda.  \r\n\r\nThis is moral treason.  Evict the Tea Party extremists, vote in new blood (R or D or I, I dont care), and demand repayment for all the 'hard work' they did in DC these last 2 years.  \r\n\r\nIf you dont, you are as much the cause for our malaise.  I would prefer we all were the cure.  \r\n\r\nHang in there, all cycles must end as well.

Obama is more economically clueless than Carter was.   His socialist policies amount to a war on the American middle class.   That is why 42% are now collecting government checks, and we have 1/4 of the country on food stamps.  He has converted 1/4 of the middle class into poor. \r\n As Marx said, you cannot create a socialist society before you eliminate the middle class.   If Obama has 4 more years he may succeed.  Sadly, those collecting will always vote for democrats, so we have 47% who will vote to increase their benefits at the expense of those that earn a living. \r\n The question is do Americans want freedom and liberty or a welfare check....

Hmmmm  -- I thought "Marrying Up" was a term to indicate WEALTH, not Education. \r\n  \r\nHere's some food for thought -->  My wife and I got married just out of college.  At the time, we both had Bachelors of Science degrees.  Then, about 20 years later, she decides to get her Masters Degree -- so, according to this article, I "married up". \r\n  \r\nBut here is the kicker -->  I still earn more than my wife, even though she has her Masters Degree and I only have a Bachelor of Science degree.  Why?  Because I'm an engineer, and she's a teacher. \r\n  \r\n"Marrying Up" has NOTHING to do with education.  It is a term that describes WEALTH.

Geez, so much mis-information on here.  Annheuser Busch was sold to AmBev, which is in Belguim  (not Germany or Austria or China).  Bud is still brewed in several breweries in the USA, so it is still an American product.  It is really sad that this cost-cutting maniac of a CEO is raping the Bud brand.  I enjoyed Bud for a long time but switched to Stella Artois (Belgian).   This CEO sounds exactly like my CEO who laid off 54,000 Americans and invoked a two-year, global wage freeze while he Gorged himself on over $100M in bonuses over that two-year period.   How about that for Leadership? "All of your families are just going to have to suck it up for two years while I walk off with all of the Treasure".  Sickening ... and the same thing happens all along Wall Street.  These Harvard and Yale boys have a  completely different sense of Ethics and Honor than what we were taught back in the day.

CLEVELAND -- The stakes for President Obama could not be higher in this liberal bastion, an economically hard-hit region in the nation's premier battleground where the incumbent needs a massive turnout to prevail on Nov. 6.\r\nFor Obama, this area is a firewall that could offset likely gains by Republican Mitt Romney throughout other stretches of Ohio -- but fault lines have emerged.\r\nEarly voting, touted as Obama's secret weapon in the Buckeye State, is down nearly 10 percent in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, compared to the same time in 2008. Even before Hurricane Sandy ushered in nasty rain, early turnout was lagging behind the benchmark it set four years ago, local election figures show.\r\nPolitically speaking, the failure to turn out a vote in this Democratic fortress is almost as good as casting a vote for Romney. And even while the number of Democrats voting early is down, there are indications that some of those who are voting are crossing over to Romney instead.\r\n"I come from a Democratic family, a union family," said Dave Koler, an information technology program manager from North Royalton. "The first debate was a real swing for me. This might be the first time that I actually go Republican."

I have to stop laughing for a minute. I see that the concensus people seem to be in a dream world when they seriously thought only 3000 people wouldn't be making unemployment claims from two weeks ago, to this week. On the other hand they want you to believe that 158K new jobs were created, a jump from the 114K jobs from last month. Whoever the bean counter is at this government office, should be hanged, shot, drowned and buried in cement! what a bunch of crap. If you beleive this government info, you really should vote for Obama because your as dumb as they come and deserve the misery that will await you over the next four years if he's back in office again!

You are right Women are spoiled because men love us. However that doesn't give women the right to be a complete b**ch and treat her man like crap.  I must say my husband spoils me and I do the same for him. He makes me feel like a Queen but minus all the stupid drama. That is why I have a 13 year old daughter. I give 100% to my husband and I expect the same. No more//No less!  \r\n  \r\nMy husband is a stay at home dad of our 5 children and I work outside the home. When I get home from work our house is clean and that's when I take over with the kids. I was the stay at home parent for awhile and so I know how hard it is. I always try to help with whatever remaining chores there are left but he fights me and tells me "No honey, go relax you just worked all day!" I love him for that but it is still my job as a mother and a good wife to say hey shhh, here's a cold beer now go away and watch football.

Who are they kidding?  Improved employment numbers?\r\n \r\nCurrent unemployment reporting methodology adjusted for estimated long-term discouraged workers, who were defined out of official existence in 1994 is added to the BLS estimate of U-6 unemployment, which includes short-term discouraged workers. The U-3 unemployment rate is the monthly headline number. The U-6 unemployment rate is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) broadest unemployment measure, including short-term discouraged and other marginally-attached workers as well as those forced to work part-time because they cannot find full-time employment.  Adding  U-6 plus plus the long term discouraged workers (defined out of existence in 1994) translates to an overall unemployment rate of about 22%.      Just take a sampling of 50 to 100 people of all ages and  ethnicity and you will find that a little more than 1 in 5 is unemployed or underemployed.    Seasonal employment provides a pop in employment around the holiday season, but then goes away after the 1st of the year.

Broward County Sheriff Al Lamberti chose to comment about this saying the background checks revealed the criminals involved. Where was he last month with background checks of his right-hand man campaign advisor Bill Lewis who has never been background checked by Lamberti shows up with an 11 YEAR PRISON RECORD for a felony arrest? Lamberti couldn't (or wouldn't) background check his own people and it blew up in his face! Don't we need a sheriff that gives as good as he gets?

It would be nice to wake up to the beautiful morning where the world was at piece and everyone could walk hand in hang. GIVE ME A BREAK. The rest of the world is a tough place to live and those who have never seen any of it can have these fantasy dreams. \r\nIf the bleeding hearts got ride of everything that was grown, manufactured and processed by other than college graduates they would be starving and naked. \r\nThis story is a joke because people in other parts of the planet have to work to live. Working starts about the time they can walk and ends when they aren't breathing anymore. \r\nI'll have another Almond Bar please. \r\nYou are all going to love living under strict Islamic rules. \r\nGBA

The non union workers are not after your jobs. So I say to IBEW back off. If ;you think you can do it on your own you are totally wrong. I am keeping my mouth, and or keyboard, censored as I have words I could use against you and your hieirarchy but I won''t at this time. Let the others work and help the people who need it.  NOT YOU.

Serioiusly?  They you better not put gas in your car that comes from the middle east.  Little girls there are "circumcized" at 12 so that they wont enjoy sex.  Or they are shot in the street for wanting to go to school.  And dont even let me get started on China where women are forced to have abortions if they have more than one child, and baby girls are regularly killed--just because they are girls.   Dont be so high and mighty about this.  All the third world counties, where so much of our clothes come from exploit children.  If you are ready to grow your own ingredients for chocolate, go right ahead.   \r\n        I believe this has more to do with our country's crackdown on business and on sugared treats, like chocolate.

I hope someday the general public will wake up and see that there are other people to vote for and they will go and do the research instead of depending on paid advertisements and paid new corps to get their info.. Until then we are all doomed. Hope we like paying taxes because at this rate we will be lucky to keep half of what we make.

It wouldn't have been my child because I would ensure that my child had been brought up as I had: to be respectful, heed authority and understand that I would punish them far worse than anyone else.  \r\n   Having taught for a decade and dealt with many knot-headed children, a small part of me chuckles.  Many a teacher would have LOVED to have zapped a child or two at one time or another.  \r\n   However, I can sympathize with commenters who would go after the cop with everything they had at their disposal.  And the parents certainly would not be wrong.  There's no question that the cop was crazy and doesn't need to be in his job any longer.

Not everyone suffers during trying times, some are prepared. What is striking is the number of people who are not self sufficient, were not prepared, and are now angry that the calvary won't be quick to the rescue. Just like Katrina we see the ill prepared lashing out with criticism of a system they think should take care of them from cradle to grave. This incident should act as a clear example of the flaws associated with liberalism. Choosing to congregate with millions of other people in a very small geographic area is not a crime, but the person who does so should recognize the limitations of services purportedly offered by a socialist model. Here in the mid-west we understand and we prepare. It would be unusual for us to find a neighbor who did not have adequate food/water, first aid supply, auxiallary power, hand radios, arms etc... but if we did we would be in a positon to help. Ask not what your city government can do for you, ask what you can do for your neighbor.

Actually Washington DC real estate tax appraisals and or values are determined by a computer program and the appraisers give the DC owner the opportunity each and every year to address by providing evidence that the computerized appraisal is inaccurate. However, one must make the effort each and every year to ensure the appraisals remain accurate and up to date. There are not enough employees to go to each and every property in Washington DC and appraise each individually. However DC real estate taxes are too high and need to be reduced significantly.

Yeahhhh....no.  Your issue is obviously leaning on putting Romney in the seat of President of the USA.  How about NO ONE for President, lets leave the office vacant and on recess for awhile.  Obama, Romney, and all other partisan politicians are liars and garbage.   They are the ones who don't really care about you or me, they are only looking out for themselves and playing these finger pointing games.  If one still thinks like a political hive-minded honeybee, you are only going to be more disappointed in the long run.

To put the blame only on Hershey would not be correct at all. The sad thing is to grow Cocoa pure in many Countries that work labor that way. Hershey Company could have an influence on how theses operations work because they are a big buyer but the fact is they are buying imported goods. I do not expect Hershey to patrol the growing industry. I think we should have a restricted import policy with Counties that allow this to happen.

Actually, yes I have, and I really enjoy how it works and I plan on using Khan Academy a lot more in the near future. I just haven't had the time to study math that much lately, which I'm sure sounds like a crappy excuse.  \r\n I have been busy with other things, but I'm pretty sure I could find the time if I just tried a bit harder and stopped letting people and things distract me.

This article isn't about weather or not you should or shouldn't eat chocolate..It's about a union who chose to elect to put some of their pension money into the stock market to make it grow...If you don't like what they possibly or no doing pull your money out and invest someplace else, hurt them where it hurts most in their pocket book.

What a beautiful pet! I'm a nurse and before any procedure, we have a 'time out' and everyone in the room or to be involved in the procedure, stops what they are doing and everyone must agree the right patient, right procedure. Obviously, staff need better training and supervision and the shelter needs to have their procedures reviewed for animal safety! Why was Zion quarantined if he didn't bite, only jumped? Why wasn't he placed in a different room from strays to be euthanized? Couldn't they have a plastic strip put on the front of the cage door that says "Stop! Do NOT euthanize."\r\n Didn't they have a collar with Zion's name on it? Maybe if pets had collars with their names someone would stop and think he was a pet, not a stray. Even color coded collars. With digital cameras (no film developing cost) they could take a photo of the pets so pets wouldn't be mixed up with strays (no photo). So sorry for Zion and Matthew! RIP Sweet Zion!

Really?.At least the mother of one of the Navy Seals that got killed didn't have to tell Obama to stop using her sons name in his speeches.A man who Mutt met for all of a minute and not only had to be reminded when and where he met him but he also had to be reminded what his name was.Then what did he do? He went around making speeches and claiming how he personally knew this man and was just heartbroken when he found out he'd been killed. So to simplify it for you he used the death of this Navy Seal whom he didn't even remember meeting and who's name he didn't know until being told to further his political agenda and he did it until he was told to stop by the Seals mother.Whom by the way was highly offended that Mutt used her sons name in that way!!\r\nSo I hate to burst your bubble but Mutt doesn't care about anyone or anything but himself and his political agenda!

Most likely scenario is that we will have the same POTUS  and Senate controlled by the Democrats and the House controlled by the Republicans for at least the next 2 years.   In other words, SOS.  Hopefully, cooler heads will prevail and real progress will be made, but that might be asking too much of congress.

I can understand the various issues but offhand I think this went too far.  Her shirt said vote the Bible but not who or what to vote for because of that... there are after all some people of faith who are liberal -- for example, those who belong to "The Religious Left" -- who would vote liberally and democratically BECAUSE in their view they are voting the Bible.\r\n\r\nI think the law was meant to prevent pandemonium with shouting crowds holding signs for this or that right at the doors to the polling place or even inside.

An old man mentality.  LISTEN, the writer at Kipplinger is one who actually made it out of tens of thousands who didn't.  LISTEN, saying college doesn't matter or what you major in college doesn't matter and all it takes is hard work is an antiquated idea.  Today's world considers college degree as a must.  What sets college-educated candidates apart is the major, specifically, quantitative majors.  If you major in any of the 10 majors, 99.99% is doomed to hand-to-mouth life.  These aren't majors.  They should be minors.

"commercially bred" Does NOT mean puppy mill.  Just because a person may breed animals for a living (even a LOT of animals) it does *NOT* mean they are being cruel to them.  The law should focus on finding and punishing people that are doing wrong.  Destroying an entire industry because of a few bad people is just WRONG.  (Face Palm Time)

You are worried about CMG being overvalued in an article that mentions AMZN??? Seriously? That is laughable. Don't get me wrong, a forward P/E of 25 is nothing to get excited about. However, AMZN has a forward P/E of 131.79 with negative income growth (vs CMG which although slowing is still positive growth)!!! I'll give you two MUST-SELL stocks... AMZN and LNKD (forward P/E of 296.83). Yeah LNKD has huge positive growth but it is a new company and 250% of $0.15 is still pocket change. New companies with little income are a lot easier to grow at huge rates. It isn't sustainable though. I don't own CMG and I have no plans to buy any but it certainly wouldn't be anywhere near the top of my must-sell list. What a joke.

Because adopting a new dog will replace the one they killed? To some, dogs are family, they become kids for those who can't have kids. I can't just accidentally kill a kid at daycare and be like oops my bad here why don't you just take another kid home. \r\nTalk about lawsuit right here, if that was my dog I would sue them for all they had, including seeing that the woman in charge is fired and not allowed near a dog ever again.

I agree with the others that what they are trying to pass off as country music is not country music.  These people were obviously raised on rock and that is what they really want to do.   You can't listen to country on the radio.   Country music is dead.

From a speech by Grover Norquist:\r\nAll we have to do is replace Obama. ... We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don't need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. We want the Ryan budget. ... We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don't need someone to think it up or design it. The leadership now for the modern conservative movement for the next 20 years will be coming out of the House and the Senate. \r\nThe requirement for president? \r\nPick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become president of the United States. This is a change for Republicans: the House and Senate doing the work with the president signing bills. His job is to be captain of the team, to sign the legislation that has already been prepared

Bad thing is many officers these days including troopers try to ticket the law abiding drivers by instilling speed traps. For some reason they never mentioned that in this article and its the biggest revenue generator for them. I got out of my speed trap ticket and even caught them red handed doing it (compliments of Google Earth). They were taking the caution school bus stop signs down and changing them to the speed limit signs that were over what the speed is on this road, then they take em down and started busting people for going 10 over.  The same exact time they were putting one of those improper speed limit signs, google earth was taking a arial shot of that area. You can almost make out his face as he is erecting the 55 mph sign and shows the cars in the 50 ft area. One was a Black n White. WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT HAPPENING?  It really puts a new perspective on law enforcement when you have some that are supposed to uphold the law, breaking the law to generate revenues in their counties. Its a huge black eye for every law enforcement officer out there, and the bad thing is speed traps are getting more common everyday.

Yeah, yeah, 'knocked around' and 'some states'... even then, it was tied to military service.  "Old enough to fight, old enough to vote", and all that.  But, people's reaction to the draft during the Vietnam War was the final straw that broke that particular camel's back.  With overruling Oregon versus Mitchell being a distant second.  And, what's wrong with using the word niggling when that is exactly what you are doing?  You are being petty, exacting and fussy... if the shoe fits...\r\n \r\nAnyhow, you can have the last word on this.  You can use it to list all of the myriad other reasons for lowering the voting age, that didn't have to do with the draft and student activism and people being fed up with being asked to serve but not having a say. (or Oregon versus Mitchell, since I've already mentioned that)  You might also want to explain how it even matters... since this was all just a 'what if' senario to begin with.

That's it Mike! Both my parents retired from teaching frustrated. They both were very dedicated teachers that truly cared about the kids education. However, if the parents are more concerned about their child being aloud to hug in school than to learn- the kids won't have a desire to learn. Kids not having the desire to learn and the parents never backing the teacher on any issue or showing any interest in their childs education only leads to the type of schooling that people want to complain about. Blame the President!

My question is who really cares if he likes kok. why did he feel the need to "come out" anyway? He could have said "my wife this," or "my girlfriend that" and he would not be lying! The whole gay, lesbian thing is done. People are what they are. There was a time when inter-racial marriage was a big deal, now nobody blinks an eye. It will be a while before our society get to that point, and in all reality a part of me will be sad when that day comes. I do not want to deny somebody their rights, but I dont want homosexuality tossed in my face either.

Moviegoer, people return Uggs to Nordstrom a year later because of their return policy, because why wouldn't you wear a boot for year (that's not meant to be used in the snow), and then bring it back for a full refund when it doesn't hold up? I sold kids' shoes at Nordstrom for 3 years, and sold hundreds of Ugg boots, to adults and kids, and I always told them that they are not meant to be worn in the snow/slush and should not be used for play. They are meant for warmth indoors and for walking to the bus stop. Even if you treat them with the spray, if you step in a puddle or leave them out in the snow, they're going to get wrecked. The first pair of Uggs I ever bought was a pair with a leather sole and leather toes and only had the sheepskin on the part above the ankle. Almost 8 winters later, they are still in almost perfect shape. Some styles of Uggs are meant to be worn in the snow and winter. The regular 'classic' style is meant to be used as a slipper and to keep your feet off the hot sands of the beach (as they originated in Australia). Anyone who thinks their classic Uggs should have held up through regular winter use is an idiot, and anyone who returns said boots to a store a year later is a jerk.

They only care about making money of them. \r\n  \r\nThis law should be in effect all over not just in LA. \r\n  \r\nI live in NY and I see many pet stores. The dogs are displayed on windows. they live in a small glass holding place. They grow up in that glass place till they cannot move around. I do not know what they do to them once they grow up and can't fit in their holding place. It's sad and make me angry. When I see people looking I stop and tell them not to buy those pets. I tell them to visit a shelter where they can get healthy pets.  \r\n  \r\nIt's time they ban these stores.

Top Five Worst Obamacare Taxes Coming in 2013, out of 20 tax increases as part of Obamacare.  \r\nNancy would not let anyone read it until it was voted on. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Medical Device Tax – a $20 billion tax increase: Medical device manufacturers employ 409,000 people in 12,000 plants across the country. Obamacare imposes a new 2.3 percent excise tax on gross sales  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare “Special Needs Kids Tax” – a $13 billion tax increase: The 30-35 million Americans who use a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) at work to pay for their family’s basic medical needs will face a new government cap of $2,500 (currently the accounts are unlimited under federal law, though employers are allowed to set a cap).  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Surtax on Investment Income – a $123 billion tax increase: This is a new, 3.8 percentage point surtax on investment income earned in households making at least $250,000 ($200,000 single).  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare “Haircut” for Medical Itemized Deductions – a $15.2 billion tax increase: Currently, those Americans facing high medical expenses are allowed a deduction to the extent that those expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI). This tax increase imposes a threshold of 10 percent of AGI. By limiting this deduction, Obamacare widens the net of taxable income for the sickest Americans.  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Medicare Payroll Tax Hike -- an $86.8 billion tax increase: The Medicare payroll tax is currently 2.9 percent on all wages and self-employment profits. Under this tax hike, wages and profits exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married couples) will face a 3.8 percent rate instead. This is a direct marginal income tax hike on small business owners, who are liable for self-employment tax in most cases.  \r\n\r\n \r\n23 million out of work. 46.7 million food stamp recipients. Fewer Americans working today than Jan 2008. 16 TRILLION deficit. Obama gotta go!!

Also made oatmeal cookies and popcorn balls. Once, taking a post-Halloween walk, I noticed apples\r\nthat had been smashed onto a hearby sidewalk and I thought "INGRATES!"

You dont have any right to say what particular person or groups of people should not be included in the political debate. It just goes to show everyone that anticonservatives , while bragging all the time about how tolerant, inclusive and compassionate they are, are actually narrow minded, arrogant, mean spirited and hypocrites.

I started out in the music business as a promoter in 1978.  Traditional Country is being buried as I speak.  If it does not have a steel guitar, Stand Up Bass and NO SMOKE AND FIREWORKS...IT AIN'T COUNTRY......I was a country music lover when it was not even cool..the listeners were 40 and up! Now, the so called country music audience is, 10 to 26 years old.  Most of the new artists will be "has beens", with a few years of success....they spend all of their money...go into acting...and forget where they came from.  Today, most country music is 70's Rock, with country lyrics.  When the new wears off, it will be just...... ASSEMBLY LINE MUSIC.....Next? They overcharge for their shows.  Audience attendance is going down every day.....can not afford to see them live.  Did you know that Conway Twitty never won a country music award?..except one, for Duet of the Year, with Loretta.  That was a Music City News Award...voted by fans only.Conway was never Male Vocalist or Entertainer of the year!  Now, this is a guy with 50 plus number one songs back to back!  CMA is a bunch of crap.....they pick the winners themselves. Conway told me that awards do not matter...His fans come FIRST!  The only reason Conway..real name" Harold Loyd Jenkins", did not have any more number one hits....is because he died art age 58. Chris Young is the only singer today..that is still keeping it Country! Mark my word....Traditional Country will return....History repeats its self...RIP....Conway  ​ ..the Best Friend that music ever had .........

All pathetic, psychotic, braindead right wing radical cracked teanut dopes should listen to your leaders. They warned you about the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger during the primaries when they were able to tell he truth about this moron.  \r\nLyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch A Sketch Champion may have vision of going back home to Mexico.  \r\nAll braindead pathetic right wing radical cracked teanuts should listen to your leaders.  \r\nRick the Dick Santarium has brainwashed his followers, the evangelicals and the gay rapist, pedophile catholic priests that lyin' Willardo is a member of an evil cult and is the anti-christ. He also told them that lyin Willardo is the worst person in history to ever run for the presidency, can't be trusted and will destroy our country. Groper Nutquist, the boss of the right wing cracked teanuts and Nut Gingerhead, the criminal lobbyist, totally agreed with the last three assessments.  \r\nSo most of the evangelical sheep will probably stay home on election day or some may even vote for Obama. They are totally scared to death of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch A Sketch champion.  \r\nIf this repuke draft dodger ever became president, and war broke out in the middle east, he will be putting his dog on the top of his car and fleeing to his birthplace in Tijuana and hide in one of his 4 grandmammy's (pappy's side only) outhouses.

The interest rate returns you are seeking are in dividend-paying stocks. You're blogging on a money blog and don't know that? Some stocks are returning 13 percent in interest on top of stock gains. These are REITS. You need to get help from a financial planner. Ben Bernanke saved the stock market and has kept the dollar weak so foreigners could buy more of our goods which translates into more Americans working and fewer on the streets. Don't be a saver -- be an investor. That's the American Dream to invest enough to be able to retire early. If you don't understand how to start --- ask for advice from a financial planner or just sign up at Scottrade and research stocks for free at MSN MONEY.

I'm a retired cop after 32 years.  As for the courtesy drop I always would get around it by placing a plus sign after the actual speed written on the ticket.  For example if the person was going 60 MPH and I wanted to give him a drop of 5 MPH I would write on the ticket 55+.  This way I would testify that he was going at least 55 and probably faster.

I have a 6 year old nephew who likes to hug his friends in school. and never heard of hugging injuries it's absurd. hugging is an expression of affection if it were so bad then women wouldn't always be complaining about their mates not hugging them quite often. enough is enough now days with so many insane rules and since it's public school I suggest those parents who are mostly the ones paying for public schools to be available from their property taxes stand up against public schools and demand stupid rules be eliminated. the only schools that should be allowed so many restrictions should be private ones.

@Silverbeatle - you just displayed your supreme ignorance of the subject. \r\n Restaurant workers are paid BELOW the regular minimum wage that applies to everyone else, and are expected to make up that hourly rate via tips. \r\n Trash guys - guaranteed minimum wage. - $7.25 per hour. Teachers - guaranteed minimum wage. - $7.25 per hour.\r\n Mechanics - guaranteed minimum wage. - $7.25 per hour.\r\n \r\n Restaurant workers - the federal tipped minimum wage is $2.13 per hour.

Are these family farms the subject of this discussion?  Forced labor by bigger institutions than family farms seems to be what is being uncovered here.  Family farms that raise their children to work hard on a daily basis is something that we obviously have always practiced here in the U.S. also, but I interpreted this story to be something other than being about family farms.

In fact I did and it ties no direct path to the question posed above which reads. “Would you want a bodyguard who can’t handle his weapons?”  It does state that it is currently being viewed as an accident, but no further details will be provided until the investigation is complete.  On that note the source article does also make this statement. “In spite of its marketing as a “safe action pistol” there have been numerous incidents of what is known as “negligent discharge””.  So apparently the man isn’t alone in this type of “accident”.  So I stand by the idea that one should wait for further information before asking such a question.

Honestly, the music quality last night was horrible for most performers.  I know this is a live show, but I think some of the performers didn't bring their "A" game to the stage.  There must have been an epidemic of motorboatin' and red solo cups backstage... sad to say.   I believe the song "I am a little bit country, and I am a little bit rock n' roll" has converged into one in what Country music has become.  I love all genres of music and while I am partial to country, CMA does not stand for Country as it once was and that is sad.  George... please do not make this your final tour!  I know Country is known for drinking and done me wrong songs, but listening to the words to some of new music makes me cringe when it becomes a role model for our kids.  While I have my favorites (George, Reba, Brad, Carrie, Lady Antebellum), I wish to give kudos to Kelly Clarkson & Vince Gill for their song last night... loved it!

Waitress and waiters receive some of the lowest wages of any US citizens.  Employers depend on the other guests to make up the difference with tips.  I wonder if this single Mom was ever a waitress trying to provide for her children, I bet her service provider is a parent, too.  Perhaps service people should be paid a fair wage, then this whole tipping debate would be a moot point.  P.S. in case your wondering, I provide a minimum of 20% when I eat out [as a single parent].

@kdreynolds\r\nSandy was one heck of a devistation, but i meant the traditional halloween pranks that always seems to get someone hurt. Detroit is typically associated with fires on halloween, and some idiot is always trying to hurt children via candy. But I am thrilled to no end to find out that no children in the US were hurt this year. Not even a report this morning about anything bad happening.

16 and pregnant should not make you famous.  Watching that show contributes to the downfall of this country.\r\n\r\nAnorexia and way too underweight will cause infertility.   Eat a cheeseburger, Giuliana.  Eat a bunch of them.  Maybe then you could have a baby without a surrogate, for cryin out loud. Also, have somebody check your wardrobe before you pose for photos.  There is a thread hanging off your dress... wait.  That's your arm.  Never mind.

Ah yes, Unions, the folks that brought, um not you, but overpaid civil servants, protected "tradesmen" who do nothing and unskilled laborers (IATSE stagehands anyone?) economy killing pension benefits unearned and undeserved. \r\nShouldn't we allow people who actually WANT to work to... work?\r\nIt's tough giving up your entitlements, especially when you get to sleep in in the morning, but let workers be workers and you go to the unemployment line.

What about the POTUS's handling of security in Bengazi before and after the murder of Amb. Stevens and three Americans???   He had cables and e-mails warning of vulnerabilities at the compound and live video streaming at the time of the attack and did nothing!   Where are the brains there?  Where is the caring and concern there?  POTUS hides behind a stupid unrelated video in his speech at the UN conference and hides behind Hilary who is the only one who has guts enough to take responsibility.

Another human travesty all for the sake of the almighty dollar so corporate heads can keep getting million dollar compensation packages.  If these atrocities are uncovered, addressed head-on, resolved so that the issue is eliminated, maybe then we can become a better world.\r\n \r\nUncover them.  Apple has faced the heat (and continues to do so overseas) for their supply chain practicing immoral employment tactics.  Apple has people directly oversea or at least audit these situations, however, no one can tell whether they are 100% compliant --- we all hope so.\r\n \r\nCorporations (the leading decision-makers) need to open up their conscience and let some of that money go that they get for facilitating this type of practice and the profits that are manifested by it.  The shareholders (corporate and you and me) just need to realize that profits many times will go down, but there's still enought money to go around so that everyone benefits.  \r\n \r\nI have for the last three decades that it's time that we as a society and world now need to make concessions and compromises, for what we are doing is wrong.  We will all survive, and some will just have to go without that 120 feet boat that they so direly need...

HELLO;  My name is Larry and have worked for a gas utility for over 30 years as a ditch digger and burying gas pipe.  On call 24 hrs. a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. With no excuses for not reporting to work when called .  No stand by pay either.  I come from a industrial state (michigan) . I'm not going back to the early 1900's either we should all know what the history books say in regards to forced child labor,prohibition, and saftey labor laws that did not protect laborers.  \r\n\r\n  I belonged to a labor union and did everything to support them. Was the sargent of arms for a long time. We can all blame unions for everything, but if we have a union brother or sister not pulling there own it is the unions fault for letting then get away with it. and making us look bad.  Nobody is going to make the union look bad in front of me or my other brothers look bad by goofing off, stealing ,or not doing there job. Unions are to police there  own members and assist the company in making a profit. When they make more so do I and my union Brothers and Sisters.\r\n\r\n  A Union is only as good as its members.

How anyone can chain smoke the way this "chef" does and pretend to be a gourmand or gourmet is a big joke perpetrated on his fans.  Science has proven conclusively that smoking severely dulls not only one's sense of taste, but also that of smell - which plays a huge part in one's sense of taste.

All I can say is that whenever in the past when I followed the advice of being polite, the cop usually wrote me a ticket.  I usually won't fight them because the money isn't worth the bother.  But one time I was so obviously right that I took it to court and the judge reprimanded the cop and threw it out right there and then. \r\nNow I don't bother being polite.  Instead I tell the cop off, tell him where he is wrong and how I will take him to court and beat him on it.  I do so while quoting the law.  Knowledge is power.  One time I even told the cop that the way he made the stop was hazardous and illegal and that I would be taking that to court as well.  This time and last 2 other times I have done this over the last 10 years, the cop has just dropped it.  They don't want to go to court and actually have to prove their case.  There are too many other "polite" people out there they can make their quota with.

I have a question, if a disaster of this proportion would strike anywhere else in the world, the U.S.A. would be there in a heartbeat to help. So this, I don't care if were the biggest kid on the block, why isn't other nations offering to come in and help us with this major disaster? why the one way road? Are we to proud, or do other nations think help from us is a one way road!! In two weeks we could see a lot of snow fly in the effected area's, just what kind of disaster will we have then:) The next time there is a disaster outside the U.S. we should re-consider our aid and support, unless the nation we help is not able to reciprocate.

The unemployment rate is determined by the number of people who claim unemployment each week.  If you're unemployed, you need to check in once a week (or every other week) and say that you're unemployed.  This is why these two numbers don't appear linked.  Jobs can go up while unemployment does also.  It simply depends on the number of peoiple claiming to be unemployed.

Times have changed and so has COUNTRY.. its all pop but what I realize is that it is the kids that buy music these days and that is what sells. It will all come around ful circle it ialways does.

The whole trend of not keeping score is driven by the idea that they are all winners and was the founding principle of this school of thought, so it is not a "straw man thrust upon the position", it is the default position of your entire argument. You are asking me the same questions that I've already answered in my previous post, you have posed nothing new, you're just twisting the message and saying the same things over again like it will lend them any credence.

I left the union and went into management while vesting my years in the union When it came time for me to collect on my pension I was told that I did not qualify for it. Again I told them to go pound sand and to this day I will not buy anything union made and I will talk these bastard's down every time an opportunity comes my way. How people can pay extorsion money is beyond me. i'am doing just fine with the money I make and work for Without paying extorsion dues. God bless America

WOW she must not of ever waited tables or worked in customer service businesses either.  Waiting tables is one of the hardest jobs, waiting on the public can be very tough & unappreciative.  I waited tables for years even after it help put me through nursing school.  If I have a new waiter/waitress I can tell, so I tell them please tell your customers you are new at this & please have patience.  If you aren't new @ waiting tables then I start them @ 20% if they earn it they get it if they don't then I tell them why they didn't get the full 20% but I have never not left something.  The money on the table is their bill money not their check!  If you can afford to have a $140.00 check, single mom or not, is not an excuse to not tip, that's just plain WRONG!  This person should be very ashamed of herself & go grocery shopping & eat at home.

County musicians have such class.  You don't see the entertainers all drugged up, you don't have to listen to lyrics about killing people or listen to four letter words.  The CMA's are something the whole family can watch.  Country music has changed but the entertainers haven't. They are sincere, they tell a story about love, family and country life.  Sooo I wasn't surprised by the stupid headline "the worst highlights".  This is so typical of MSN, which is as far left as you can get.  They would rather report about all the dump things the  Hollywood  misfits do everyday. There's definitely more to report .  Like a typical liberal they cannot say anything nice about anything or anybody with out getting in a few jabs.  The CMA is one of the best events on TV and the only time I watch that liberal station.  I wish they would air it on the CMT station.

Earlier this week, the Press Trust of India that the United States will "be spending a whopping $200 million per day on President Barack Obama's visit" to Mumbai.  \r\nThe story lacked a named source, and the $200 million claim was credited to "a top official of the Maharashtra Government privy to the arrangements for the high-profile visit." \r\nThe claim quickly gained traction on the right, thanks in part to a link on the conservative news aggregator The Drudge Report. Among those citing it is Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, who on how she would reduce the deficit by citing the cost of the presidential trip.  \r\n"Well I think we know that just within a day or so, the president of the United States will be taking a trip over to India that is expected to cost the taxpayers $200 million a day," she said. "He's taking two thousand people with him. He'll be renting out over 870 rooms in India. And these are 5-star hotel rooms at the Taj Mahal Palace hotel. This is the kind of over-the-top spending, it's a very small example, Anderson." \r\nCBS News asked the White House about the story yesterday, and the White House said in an email that "The numbers reported in this article have no basis in reality."  \r\n"Due to security concerns, we are unable to outline details associated with security procedures and costs, but it's safe to say these numbers are wildly inflated," the official said.  \r\nAt his press briefing today, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said that while he would not get into the costs of protecting President Obama, they are "comparable" to what they have been for past presidents in similar circumstances.

Guiliana wanted a baby more than anything in the world. She miscarried, went through IVF, and then found out she had breast cancer. Hormone shots, Finally through surragocy, she was lucky enough to have a son. Two weeks after receiving her "miracle baby" she's back to work. Now this is what I don't understand: You spend thousands and tens of thousands of dollars to have a child you tell everyone is your only dream - that which will make your marriage complete and then you go back to work after two weeks. STAY HOME and be a mom. God knows you have enough money and if necessary, do a special now and again, but stay home and be a mom!

In most states, a pet owner can only sue for "market value" of the pet and since Zion was a lab mix, he is not considered to be worth much. It would costs more in attorney's fees than the owner would get. \r\n \r\nIf people could get compensation for "sentimental" value, veterinary fees would have to go up dramatically to cover liability insurance. Kennels, dog walkers, even family and friends watching your pet would be at risk for a lawsuit.  (I work in the veterinary field and this has been a hot topic for the past several years.)\r\n \r\nIt sucks, I know. I have been seeing  photos of animals (in addition to the people) lost in Sandy and it makes me want to never leave my dog ever again.

If there were no Expert Witness and no on-line Barnes and Noble site, so that the Byrne piece was physically printed on paper somewhere in the world like it was still 1979 or something, and I had read that it existed but the printed location was as elusive as good arts writing was then, I would right now be driving from library to library in this town hoping that they had the publication I was looking for.\r\n\r\nI guess that's an acknowledgement of the value of technology and instant access, but what it's intended to be is a compliment to Bob for how astonishingly well he does those long forms, chock-a-block with info and with critical assessment. Or to steal from his Townshend book review, his writing gathers "explanatory mojo" by focusing on, packing in, layering, and then re-layering explanatory content.

I saw them on Dec 6, 1979 in Portland Me. It was my 17th birthday. They come onstage and after 5 songs Steve Tyler passed out. They kept us waiting for 2 hours to see if he would come to. He never did and they canceled the show.

I hate to sound like some smuck but once you clasify your relationship as "marrying up" or "marrying down" you will likely have problems. Marriage is a partnership...not employment.

I got an idea do not give your money to any other person ever. How can your money be important to someone who looks at numbers all day. I have saved and every time some investment guy calls and gives the prospectus. It is nothing that helps you , they like to take as much of your money as they can. To many people in this country are not liquid it is all assets. Save your money yourself because nobody else cares about you they just want to steal your money.

Tom Wolfe's essay on American intellectuals also summarizes the origins of Fascism and Nazism rather well. Here is one excerpt from it: \r\n\r\n\r\n"Fascism" was, in fact, a Marxist coinage. Marxists borrowed the name of Mussolini's Italian party, the Fascisti, and applied it to Hitler's Nazis, adroitly papering over the fact that the Nazis, like Marxism's standard-bearers, the Soviet Communists, were revolutionary socialists. In fact, "Nazi" was (most annoyingly) shorthand for the National Socialist German Workers' Party. European Marxists successfully put over the idea that Nazism was the brutal, decadent last gasp of "capitalism."

He's obviously pretty upset, but I'm not sure how he thinks it will help the problem. There will always be people who abuse and kill, no public awareness message will stop them. It's the ones being abused who need to get the message---to leave. If that inspires a woman to leave her abuser than I guess it's a good thing. But I'm thinking this is more a grief response. Now, using his connections and visibility to open a safe-house would be a more practical approach. Helping women find jobs, setting up situations for people to donate so centers can stay open, now that's doing things.

I took a couple of hits of a joint at an Iron Maiden concert. The couple standing next to me had pulled one out and I looked over at them while they were lighting it and just smiled. Next thing I knew they were passing it my way. I wasn't going to be driving and my kids were staying the night with my parents so I figured "what the heck."

You may not like what you get with Obama but you might like Romney less if elected. According to a speech by Grover Norquist with Romney you won't get a president you'll get a rubber stamp for Ryan.\r\n  \r\nAll we have to do is replace Obama. ... We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don't need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. We want the Ryan budget. ... We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don't need someone to think it up or design it. The leadership now for the modern conservative movement for the next 20 years will be coming out of the House and the Senate. \r\nThe requirement for president? \r\nPick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become president of the United States. This is a change for Republicans: the House and Senate doing the work with the president signing bills. His job is to be captain of the team, to sign the legislation that has already been prepared

Fat Tire Belgian-style Ale out of Ft. Collins, CO, is an excellent brew, even if it is a bit pricey.  Surprisingly, Killian's Irish Red (actually now brewed by Molson-Coors) is comparable.  Killian's used to be a true Ireland-brewed Ireland-owned red ale, but Killian's was bought by Coors about 25 years ago, and it is now actually a red lager, not a red ale.  Still not bad.

You know i am a little disapointed in the human race right now. You all do not know this woman or the amount of kids she has or if that was a special night for one of them. All you know is what that waiter wants you to know. I do not all ways tip either and it is not because the waiting person does a bad job but because i can only buget in so much for the family to go out on and it sometimes is not enough to tip. So for those of you that think that the only thing that is important is the tip heres a tip: You are the ones that can cause a place to go out of business so be careful of what you say about your customers cause it could backfire.

What doesn't make sense to Giuliana Rancic may make sense to a 16 yr. old. This show is about the true reality of having a baby at the Young and Immature age of 16. The show is there to educate teens of the reality and consequences of having a baby at such a young age! If she doesn't like the show then she should NOT be watching it. The ratings are fairly good and that is why the show has been brought back for several seasons. Giulinana should NOT be judging people, although WE ALL tend to sometimes go that route. I DO NOT agree with her BUT WILL NOT Bash her either. As far as her having a nanny or even nanny's take care of her child, she has the money to do it so let her. By her having a nanny she is MISSING out on as much as the teens are when it comes to being around their child and that is something she will regret later in life!!

I did catch my husband in his workshop with a younger woman 3 mos. ago. She was drugging him with toluache(Datura). We have been married 43 yrs. He said he wanted to tell me that he didn't think our relationship was great, that he doesn't like to talk to me and  that he had selected his 2nd wife. Of course since the beachfront property and business is in my name, he doesn't want to leave cause he "loves me" and since it was only sex not love well he thinks we should go back to our relationship the way it was. We can't go back cause that relationship doesn't exist anymore. Now he acts like it was my fault he screws around. I am advised to do nothing for the moment. We have a big house so he can sleep, eat and live anywhere he wants but not with me. I didn't move here to bust my butt so he can have his street ho's. Oh yeah I was sick for over a year and his statement that he had needs is full of hot air.. I had needs and I still have them so does that make it ok for me to go out and look for a younger man? Legally I don't have to give him anything until I sell but he is welcomed to leave any time. I have time on my side since I am much better health-wise. The best part is that I am thinner and look younger. I Am praying more and am looking forward to the rest of my life. He broke the marriage contract not me. He knew there would be consequences but isn't sure what they are......DUH

Really? I can't believe people are so cruel to say that it "is just a dog". Obviously you have never experienced the love and devotion that they give. They don't care what kind of day you had, what you look like, if you are sad or mad. I have rescued since I was a teen and there have been 15 so far. The one that we just lost knew when my husband had low blood sugar and would wake him before it was too late and she wasn't trained to do that. Each one of their personalities are different too so to say that it can be replaced is wrong. Maybe you should keep your thoughts to yourselves instead of being hurtful. I would have the love of a dog any day than to be friends with people like you. It says a lot about a person......the way he treats animals. Shame on all of you!

A CPAP is not inexpensive unless it is prescribed by a sleep specialist and covered by insurance. For one who suffers from sleep apnea, though, it can literally be a life saver (which I can tell you from personal experience). It still, however, will not help one GET to sleep.%0D%0DYes, a comfortable dark room has helped me as well as removing distractions. Doing or watching or reading something inane rather than brain-stimulating has also helped me. Sex works, too! :-)

It's better to be single than supprt a unmotivated dead beat.  It is srprising how many of these guys think that they "are the man" and should controll all the decisions.  I think that two incomes, split the joint expenses by the percent of income, with each earner keeping the rest for discressionary spending.  This way both are motivated to succeed. In case of divorce, most assets have been split.  And also, get a prenup.\r\n \r\nA guy thought he would marry my daughter and she would pay his $100k debt, support him through school, and move where ever he got a job.  His parents and past girfriends ruined him.  My daughter, showed him how to get out of debt, got him in school, and sent him on his way.  Not a keeper and even if you love him he was way too messed up.  He resented her for leading him.

F N indiots....Just exacfly how much say do you have in where your tax money goes..near zero! We vote for leaders to use our money as wisely as possible...EVEN in unions. The unions are not going to want someone in office who is against them, just like the anyone else...it makes very little sense. So special interests are not just the unions.. people...it's the oil, and realestate, corporate and financial tycoons that started the whole mess. If we did not have unions...think about it..if you can do that at all. Those who are against are simply pissed that they went their entire life at the bottom and just jealous of others attempts at climbing up. $10 an hour is too much to qualify for medical or dental assistance....has any of you seen a doctor or dentist bill..and you wonder why we need ObamaCare. Get real, the $10 hour job doesn't pay enough, but will always be a $10 job that someone has to do because it's probably washing cars or serving food and doesn't require much education to do it, but don't those working that service industry job deserve at least a doctor or dentist visit without going bankrupt. People are so ignortant.

I wish people would read more than just the headline. It was confirmed by the governor of NJ (who is republican). And the company that no workers were turned away because of being nonunion.  As far as union workers doing a better job I would say that there are very good workers in both the union and nonunion work forces.  What I can say about union workers inthe construction industry is that all members attend an accredited apprentice program receive health benefits and a retirement plan and are legal citizens.  Is there anything wrong with this?

The article is inaccurate with regard to winning when going to court.  Most cases that people actually testify against the officer end up as being found guilty.  If you are gambling about the officer showing up or not that is technically not a victory, but a dismissal because the officer has failed to appear.  Your chances of that happening are 50 / 50 because remember more than likely the officer is getting paid overtime to be in court in the first place or already on duty and looking to get out of the field.  The traffic cops almost always show up because that is what they do, besides most of them have already gotten their tickets by the time court roles around in the afternoon.  Be careful with some of the advice being given by "supposed experts" because you might get frustrated with the results.  Motor cops, just be polite because most likely they're going to give you a ticket because that is their assignment.  The car cops, really be polite and despite what these alleged attorneys suggest, be honest, chances of you getting a warning are far better.  Remember when a cop hears, "Officer I don't know why you pulled me over" when the question is presented to you, most cops think you're lying at that poing anyways.

Yep crookseverywhere and most of them are 47%'ers.  Romney released his tax returns that showed he paid taxes.  And you?  If you were forced to expose your tax returns when there was no law saying you had to would you?  Would you do it just because some political party made it an issue so that their candidate looked better?  The mindset of some, and I;m not pointing fingers at you, are simpletons that make up their mind as to whom they are voting for based solely on attack ads on television.  Lets not do that, but rather vote for the person who can do the best.for us.\r\n  In order to do that you need to look at every candidates record.  In the presidential election we have a failed administration versus a candidate who has a record of running successful businesses and a state.

He falls under the category of tall tales and extreme personal detail.

I can see his side to a point. My first was born via c-section and my husband jokes he saw a side of me he never wanted to - the inside. I could understand if it took a couple of months to get past that. Heck those first 2-3 months you're so tired anyway it's really not a big deal. But a full year? That moves it past "reasonable" to his having issues in my book.

You never have a camera when the funniest things happen.  Over the summer, I went out into my backyard and my cat, Kelly, who is an indoor cat, but who I let out sometimes and who doesn't try and get away and bring back inside when I go back in.  But anyhow, suddenly, here comes this dog around the side of the house and into my yard.  The dog and my cat both froze when they saw each other.  Then my cat puffed up and you could see by her stance (facing the dog and leaning forward) that she wasn't all that happy by having this dog enter HER yard.  Then, without a meow or a bark, my cat took off running ... not away, but at the dog!!!  The dog, shocked out of his fur, took one look at my cat coming after him, turned tail and bolted out of the yard and down the street.  I could almost hear his thoughts, "What the heck?!"  My cat took up a position at the edge of the yard, sat down and without further concern, began to wash her paws. \r\n \r\nYep, cats are funny animals!!

Yes, in Florida after a hurricane in 2004. At a gas station after a  very very long  wait. The man in the car in front of me lost it when another man approached with a gas can and asked to pump some gas after him. They started to argue and the man reached in his car and pulled out a gun. I didn't see what happened next since I tried to crawl underneath my car seat. But the man with the gas can came up to me when I started to pump my gas next and I let him have gas. I have to say he was brave to approach again after having a gun pulled on him.

"Insurance companies rate tickets differently," Gusner says, "and while your current one may raise your rates 10%, another one may not raise your rates on just one minor offense or surcharge you only 5% for it." \r\n  \r\nI'd like to know, on what planet do you sell insurance.   \r\nOne speeding ticket, (10 mph over), increased my premiums by 25 %  for 3 years, in Ca. back in the 90's.(not 5% or 10% ) \r\n After 2 1/2 years I was unfortunate enough to recieve another speeding ticket,(8 mph over).  \r\nHow much did my insurance increase after the 2nd one? 300%.  That's right, tripled. What a racket. \r\nAfter 6 months the first ticket dropped off my record. The insurance company REFUSED to reduce my premium until I renued my anuall policy 6 months later. I had to drop that company and start with another company just to get my premiums back down to a reasonable amount.

As someone who works at the local courthouse and sees first hand marriage dissolutions, I can tell you  that I would never EVER get married. The amount of anguish, turmoil and financial costs that people go through to get out of their marriage far outweighs any positives a union may bring. No need to sign that paper. Live together, whatever but unless you want to lose half your stuff, mess up your kids really good and get eaten alive my attorneys, DONT GET MARRIED.

Only if you let it.  It also depends on how the couple views childbirth:  beautiful for the precious new beginning or ugly for the pain and mess.  My mother always told me I would forget the pain when I held my baby  - big fat lie.  However, when I held each child it was so worth every single second.  I was fortunate that it brought my partner and I closer to marvel at the gift we had been given.

Ok, being married to a cop. Having two brother in-laws that are cops, coming from a family with a lot of cops, don't say NO when a cop asks you "do you know why I pulled you over"... You say no when you are speeding, you are definitely getting a ticket!! Cops hate idiots who say they "Didn't know they were doing 17 over..." Your speeding, the cop pulls you over and asks you "do you know why I pulled you over?" The answer most likely to get you out of a ticket, "Yes officer, I was speeding, I'm sorry.". Be honest, respectful and brief.  And, cops don't always have a choice, if their chief says write everyone doing x mile over a ticket, they have to. Just like you have to do what your boss says. And "street justice" as its called, to "reduce the actual speed on your ticket".. yeah... don't count on that... Most departments have a policy against it. And you arn't worth the cop losing their job. Who ever wrote this article is an idiot.

First, I'll bet there is WAY more to this story than is being told - cops just don't tend to be that careless. "Officer Christopher Webb allegedly said," Red flag there Second, no matter what, I feel really bad for the boy - I'm sure it was an incredibly painful and depending on the circumstances around it (which aren't told in this article) may be extremely upsetting to him. Third, I don't believe that the child is afraid of never waking up again. At least be truthful and don't exaggerate things worse than they are. Kids are very resilient, when allowed to be, but too often, there are adults who are determined that the child will never get past whatever happened.

This was not simply death- it was a senseless killing.  Some people find more comfort in their pets than in the humans in their life.  Matt stated this dog was his best friend.  How would you feel if your best friend was murdered?  Would you just 'move on'?  I had a dog who was my best friend.  I had him for 16 years.  He was a brother to my daughter and I loved him more than anything else. (Yes, he was my 'favorite' child)  He died of natural causes and I mourned his loss, but I accepted that he was a dog and would not live forever.  But if he had been killed I think I would have lost my mind.

i am by no means a hand writing expert, but i agree with a previous poster, the wirting doesn't seem to match.  also, the signature looks more like a guy's hand writing.  if it is real, she is not truly a single mom (i.e. a mother where the dad doesn't support the child(ren) in any way) when she is spending that much on a meal.  she is probably a mother who is single (a mother where the father is very much in the picture, but the mom likes to play the "single mom" card).  way to often today do mothers play that card.

Um excuse me April? I've waitressed on and off for over 20 years, and not once in all that time did i screw up as bad as this particular waitress. TIPS is an acronym for TO INSURE PROPER/PROMPT SERVICE, well lets see proper service was taken out when the waitress didnt care if one of the guests received their food, and also when the waiteress decided that she deserved a bigger tip. I have worked mothers day, christmas day and even thanksgiving, and not once did I ever behave like this waitress. Obviously she cannot handle being a waitress. Because waitresses depend on there TIPS, it is their responsibility to earn them not just expect them. This waitress was lucky to have received a flipping dime.

man, is that tacky.  she should not be eating $140 meal if she can't afford to tip, single parent or not. \r\n just a warning, about complaining about poor service or bad food, wait until after you eat.  my son's friends (who work in restaurants) have told him... NEVER under any circumstances, complain about anything, unless you want your food tampered with.  no, they should not do that... but, yes, they do it.  do you really think in this world today, the way it is, that they don't?  i wouldn't risk it.  personally. \r\n as far as me not tipping... if the waiter/waitress was rude, they can forget a tip.  and i don't feel bad about it.  i'm pleasant and kind.  if they can't act the same, they're not getting of my hard earned money.  for good service i'm a very generous tipper.

Korea build decent vehicles that will go plenty of mile before they wear out.  Also, they seemed to lag behind in the mpg department a few years ago.  Today 37 or 38 is better than before.  I'm glad  that they offered to reimburse for the difference when they over stated their mpg on their new cars.  All manufactures should do the same.

Doesn't really matter, they are just putting it out there to keep her name in the news...all those women will do anything for publicity. How much money do these celebrities need? Seriously! I couldn't spend all their money if I tried, but all they do is want more more more

Who cares who endorses who.  All this campaigning is costing an ungodly amount of money when it could be spent helping the people out in the northeast.  So close to election everyone pretty much has their mind made up as to who they are voting for.  Both Obama and Romney and any other candidate running for office should be focusing on getting these people help.  Not spending it on commercials that everyone is sick to death of.

I am very dissatisfied with the gas mileage I get from my 2013 Kia Sportage. The most I have been able to get is 24 MPG. It's a 4 banger that was supposed to get max 28MPG. I traded in a vehicle that was a 6 cylinder that got 21-26 MPG because they said this would save me money! bull****! Now i am stuck with a big payment and shitty gas mileage. Go me!

A single mom eating $ 140 worth of food ?  What did she do , order a sample of everything on the menu?  The b!tch charged the whole thing on a credit card so she wouldn't have to pay for anything right away.

Vaneby is absolutely correct as far as I am concerned. I have 27 years a a patrol officer and supervisor and I would say that I give warnings 75% of the time.  When I pull someone over they a obviously wrong and I will ask them if they know why I pulled them over, and if they say no or deny the offense it is an automatic ticket. So Vaneby drives away with a warning, smiling and WTF 101 drives away with at least 1 tcket.

20% is the lowest tip I would ever leave. I usually tip a little more. If you can't afford to tip don't go out to eat. Servers make very little in hourly wages. They don't even get minimum wage. Most are in school or have families of their own. I'm positive their utility or mortgage companies don't care if their single Mom's. \r\nI hope that was just a hoax or joke... If it wasn't?

Just bought Dylan Hicks' "Sings Bolling Greene." I was willing to have this album since I saw it here and heard the previews in his page. It's also interesting to note how things goes easily and clearly when you do the right thing: without any download issues and the quality is top-notch. And well, it costs for me R$ 18,00, since dollar is something around R$ 2. It's the double value, but worth it. "West Texas Winds" just makes me feel free, on a vacation, breezing through sunset, contemplating life itself. I don't know why I almost always feel this genre is so dissident. \r\n About Jens Lekman last one, I can't say I love it so far, but I think it's a good album, although for sure he is some kind of detained or even arrested by, and the energy we always known him for there's only a glimpse in the glorious "The End of the World Is Bigger Than Love." I also think "Some Dandruff on Your Shoulder" is a damn beautiful song, simple as it is. In this same track, you can sense how vagrant he is just saying "it's nothing" forever. But to walk alone with no apparent direction is a peaceful practice sometimes, After all, the nature will always embrace you, and you can closely feel the path, people and the air, blowing though your face. In a car or a bus, the experience can be almost similar for the first minutes, although much more painful in the next ones. That's a good thing beside the fact the traffic around where I live is so poorly I need to go walking some ways of the journey to home. Oh, "Bigger Than Love" will always remember me when I worked in a place in the other side of Pinheiros River here in São Paulo and I needed to get a bus to arrive there: it usually lasts exactly 5 minutes. Enough time to fully hear it :) That's one of the many timeless tracks I once cried.

I simply don't go more than 5 over in some speed zones and not on purpose either. I've never been stopped unless i was over by ten mph over or even more, so I figure about 5mph over this is what most officers will look the other way on. School and construction zones they will stop you for only for being over the posted speed, so I simply make sure of my speed.\r\nThe last time I was stopped my tailight had just blown that day and he pulled me over and said, You were going only three to five mph over, so i won't write you and gave me a fix it ticket. I thanked him, told him I knew the light had just failed and was going to fix it, and was on my way. \r\nIf you consider police are just doing their jobs, treat them with respect, and do give them a hard time they can and often look the other way sometimes. I've been warned for speeding simply because I said i was going a little fast.

When I first volunteered in my son's kindergarten class, I would go in a few times a week and stay for a couple of hours.. He would run to me for a hug when I arrived and when I would leave.  And as I got to know some of the other children, they would hug me too.\r\nI was told by the teacher a couple of weeks into this that it wasn't appropriate to do that, the teachers do not like that the students hug each other.. they had a 'keep your hands to yourself' sort of rule.\r\nMy response was, ' If my child, or any other child wants to give me a hug, then that's what's going to happen.  If you have a problem with that then I can volunteer my time elsewhere."\r\nShe decided it wasn't such a big deal.

That's awful!! A free cremation and a free adoption? Jesus, how is that going to fix the emotional loss of a pet? Pets become part of our family, not just a "dog" or a "cat" etc. I hate frivilous lawsuits, but this man needs a lawyer and a HUGE lawsuit! So very sorry for your loss Matt.

I own a 2010 Kia Optima ...... I get 25 MPG ...... Combined. No matter what gas I use, nor maintence I do. The car willonly get you 25MPG; however, the good part is:  I can use the cheapest gasoline, use the Air Conditioner. Drive it rough or drive it easy. It will not matter, so that is good. I must say that I drove my Optima from Las Vegas, Nevada to San Diego, California with out gasing up, so I did get 38-42 miles a gallon.  People must realize that automobiles get different milage and many factors contribute to that. Alltitute, Hills, Stop and Go, Pollution, your Exhaust Sysatem, how you Brake if you are varing your speed, Cruise Controll, how much you are on your gasoline peddle. How you stop at  lights that are coming up. Example if you coast to a light, or you hit your Brakes hard on a stop. Your grade of Oil, your Filters, and many other things.  I use to work for a company in Las Vegas, Nevad we tested: Mercede Benz, and BMW, Kia, Hyundia.  Our test showed that the Kyundia, and Kia were among the best in MPG, Maintenence, and many other factors mae these cars better then the Mercedes Benze, BMW, Toyota, Honda, GM.  I would not get upset at Hyundia, or Kia....... you are very lucky not to own Mercedes, and BMW...... they brake down a lot, and very exspensive to maintain.  When we tested these cars in the Mojave Desert, and different stituations...... your Kias, and Hyundia were superior in all of our test. If you are ever in Vegas, and you see a Tarp over an automobile or SUV.... it just might be us. In Lake Las Vegas we did testing on Audi...... they are also not very good cars; however, Fords are very good.

I stand partially corrected on InBev. They are a Belgian/Brazillian conglomerate. Check out the book "Cornered." It details the extent of monopolies that have taken over in America, including Walmart and many others such as InBev, formerly Annheiser Busch. I drink only micro brews owned by smaller American companies. The quality is incomparably better than conglomerate produced beer, and the money stays in the US, so you are in effect getting money back into your economy. It is much more expensive however. If we continue to go in the 'big brother' monopolistic direction, we will eventually become a rather large banana republic with lots of low paying jobs. If that is what you want, just sit right down and have a bud, bud, "The King of Beers."

Country died a long time ago.  This is NOT country and Taylor Swift is a pop singer that kids (little kids) like.  Once Hank Williams, Cash and Jennings were gone country was 90% dead.  Once Willie goes it is ALL over.  I don't even listen to the 'newbies'.  Thank G I've got the old boys on CD so I can hear the real thing.

I have to agree the owner of the hotel/motel is at fault, but we stay at a Days Inn Battlefield location and it very clean for a $50 stay, we always stay there always clean, nice front desk and always there to help.  Super 8 gross, and most mentioned in this story.  BUT  I do not understand why the chain does not go after the owners of the hotels and do something.  If I walk into a room something wrong I am sooooooo gone.   It makes me ill, but people need to say something.   I think they should all chuck the bedspreads.......the  ​  worst.

I see your point about the music not being country. However, I still love the true vocals of the artists.  They are not lip syncing, or computer generated.  Perhaps times are changing and the music is adapting to the mass audience.  Thank goodness we still have old school country to refer back to.  To all the beautiful artists I thank you for making my day better with your music.  Keep it up and don't forget your roots.

Also, a 600 watt wind generator may save your ****. Quite worrying about the politicians and rich folks. They are not the problem. Our government cannot fix this problem. We as Americans will have to look out for ourselves as it once was. To hell with the welfare line. If your weak and in need your community will help. Were in this together like World War 2. The Japanese did not target democrats nor Republicans when they bombed Pearl Harbor. They wanted to kill Americans. They awoke the sleeping giant.We rose united in our own defense. We shall rise again because ultimately we are all Americans. It's going to be rougher than most peaple can imagine but our forefathers, not but a few generations ago, faced much worse and what came of it was the greatest country on Earth. It's OK to let the elderly die naturally. Why do we need to preserve life 15 or 20 years beyond natural conditions. The weak are supposed to fall out and die to preserve the strength of those around them. It's in nature and all around us constantly. Survival of the fittest, as it should be. Most of my fellow Americans are just a bunch of conditioned candy asses who get all their brain washing from major television networks instead of actual research and reading. How can you criticize a system when you are clueless to what it is suppossed to be in the 1st place. Massive government socialism and intervention into private lives is a what it is designed to protect us from. Once dependent your owned. There is a lot of lazy dead weight in this country. A culling of the herd is in order. There are some real ****es and defective peaple running around reproducing with more dumb and defective peaple unchecked by natural selection, generation after generation. As a result we have 25 percent of the worlds prison population. The gap between rich and poor more acurately describes generations of improved breeding vs. the opposite. Overweight stupid peaple hook up with over weight stupid peaple enhancing those traits in the next generation. Attractive smart peaple breed with attractive smart peaple enhancing those qualities. If shear stupidity and girth is a survival factor in the future about 80 percent of you have a chance but that's not how it's going to go down. Most of you will be rounded up and slaughtered like cows saving the Chinese the trouble of having to pay your welfare and social security. In business they call it downsizing.

Crazy 8, it doesn't matter who is in power.  The whole system of our U.S. government is been run by partisan clowns who don't know jack crap about what happens abroad, especially when it comes to what happened in Benghazi.\r\n\r\nSo far, the biggest issue is at at home is dealing with the economy, which is first and foremost the biggest priority.  Neither Obama nor Romney have the ingenious master plan to cut out all the fat and flaws in the our nation's gearwork.  They make promises only and leave the Q&A business to their campaign runners.  Don't not believe in the left'n'right finger pointing-fest of the Dems and Reps , it only brings more hatred and confusion.

HAHA what is that, here we go to school for fun, its pretty easy. I never do homework and have really good grades :) And being easy and all that, only 54% of argentinian kids who started school finish. There are about 2000 peolple living in my town, we are 200 kids in all the high school, in my class 45 kids started, now we are 8 now.

Hmmmm...funny how Democrat Libs are the one supporting the innocent slaughter of unborn babies and supporting gay marriage...both of which acts are FORBIDDEN in the Bible. Keep talking your delusional smack. There is not one quality in a a Democrat Lib's policy that backs the teachings of Jesus Christ. You might want to re-read your Bible and you will find that these core values are the heart of the Conservative party. It's Dems who have removed Jesus and God from our schools and have waged war against traditional marriage and those with Christian values. If you truly love Jesus, you're dwelling with people who are on the wrong side of the fence. Sadly, it is YOU who is being deceived.

Parts of the "Northwest Passage" now being navigable in the summer\r\n5. Artic countries fighting over mineral rights to seafloor once inaccessible due to sea ice\r\n6. Rising carbon dioxide levels in seawater and concomitant acidity\r\n7. Worsening blanching of coral reefs due to their sensitivity to rising acidity\r\n8. Melting of thousands-year-old permafrost in the summer in Siberia\r\n9. Forests giving over to savannah\r\n10.Tropical insects widening their range northward (and southward)\r\n\r\nAll these things are happening.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your alternative explanation.  I'll wait.

At one time, unions made greedy corporations pay a reasonable wage, now unions are so greedy that they want to control whatever place they have infiltrated and set up shop.  The sad thing is is that people who are "unionized," are stupid enough to believe that they NEED the union.  They don't.  When the poor shlub is working and the union has their hands in the guy's pockets decrying they need more, more, more to keep their jobs safe, the honchos are living large and being driven around in limos while the shlub is trying to make a living.  Unions are too powerful and should be eradicated.  They have too much say so in how a person(s) run(s) their own company!  Then you have union sympathizers that want more, more, more in wages and benefits and what they wind up with is no job at all because the company can't afford to keep going on unrealistic demands.  Every person deserves a job whether they are union or not, and to keep one from working because he chooses not to participate in union ripoffs, is his right as an individual.  Whether you are a republican or a democrat, the union supports whomever they deem necessary to carry on their own corrupt agenda, and they are the most corrupt bunch of bastards on the planet.

It was entertainment at times. But it was not Country Music. And in trying to make it County Music they are disrespecting the whole genre. If Jason Aldean wants to be a rapper let him go elsewhere. If Faith Hill wants to try to revive a career that never was, let her try somewhere else. I saw her live way back when she was a newcomer and opened for George Strait. She couldn't sing then and she certainly has not improved. Tim McGaw was really off too. Back-up singers had to cover a lot of the notes he missed. Carrie Underwood has a great voice but it seems like everything she sings is just screaming. I understand that Blown Away is her latest hit but due to circumstances, it should have been removed from the show. The music industry as a whole is a hard business. Country Music is and for REAL people and it needs to get back to basics.

The officer should not have even pulled the taser out of his holster...loaded or not. What if it was a gun... joking or not. I would be furious as a parent. But then my boy would not of said NO.\r\nThe boy probably learned a lesson.........To respect adults and people of authority. Not saying he deserved it but this 10 year old sound like he has an attitude problem.

Defintely not country anymore. It's like high school with the "IN" crowd and the crowd that's not "IN". Where were the REAL country artists?  Trace Adkins, Hank Jr., Reba, George Strait, just to mention a few. Yes, I know they've been around a long time, but these new kids are apparently in the "IN" crowd and the really "greats" are forgotten. Sad.  It's why I don't listen to radio much anymore. I have CD's for what I like. Oh, and in my opinion, they brought Little Jimmie Dickens out just to make a joke of him.

I can't believe the casual attitude of who ever wrote the article "Happy Halloween Kids- Here's some Cocaine"  What a sick assumption to say that the drug that was given to trick-or-treaters "was postponed by "at least a few years". Like it is a given that the kids will one day use cocaine!!! Then the second part about how maybe the parents should have not reported "the spoils" and taken it for themselves "as part of the  on candy". Pretty sad when people with such a lack of respect for morals are being allowed to write things as seen from their  vies.

Small price for breaking the laws of the land and the people. No one ever real recieves true justice because you cannot hold a peice of paper (documentation of corporation) accountable for crimes because it is not a human. So the shereholders and the board get awaqy with untold crimes on humanity

They can't prove it.  One thing is for certain though.  The climate is changing.  It always is changing, so that's a given.  Earth's atmosphere is a very complex system.  We are just beginning to understand its dynamics. Alot more research needs to be done before we attempt to alter the climate or cause a global economic upheaval. When a simulation of the atmosphere can correctly reproduce the global climate of the last 100 or so years and also predict out 10 years in the future of the global climate state with 95% accuracy, WITHOUT changing any variables in the simulation between the past and the future, I'll listen to what they have to say.  Until then, I am highly skeptical of any doom and gloom scenarios.

What the hell is this comment here for: "and thus the children's experience with this class A drug was postponed by at least a few years...we wonder if some parents would have been happy not to report this 'trick' and simply take the spoils as part of the on candy." \r\n  \r\nThat is disgraceful! Does MSN think this is some sort of joke? This is a news site, and I am quite shocked that MSN would act like some immature joking child on this matter.

While I agree with most of what you said, I agree with Aqua Man in that we need to have the Electoral College for reasons such as that. Afterall, who wouldn't want to vote for Romney or Obama if they were given a couple thousand bucks to do it? I may have integrity in some areas, but money is what the world uses to go round. I'd take the money and cast the vote. A president isn't the power of the government anyway. They're just the needless face. The power, the true power, is in congress...

Hellooo!!! The Affordable Care Act has not CAUSED a rise in the healthcare costs. Healthcare costs have been rising at aggregate speed rates for the past 20 years. The industry has enjoyed few or no regulations and just like all of today's industries, PROFIT is its motivator and need is its propagator. The insurance industry is a noted behemoth when it comes to profit. Multi-million dollar CEO's, an army og lobbyist in state and federal governments, millions paid to their crony congressmen , and more to hospitals and doctors to keep their costs (insurance companies') down while increasing their profits.  The Affordable Care Act is a weak attempt to manage some control of this monster while seeking to provide health insurance to those who need it most.

lol Obamacare leaves you still at the will of insurance companies moron, all this joke of a president has done is say he is going to fine you if you dont have insurance. How is that getting us out from under the insurance companies? Did you even read his horrible healthcare package? Typical liberal, you think just because your guy put some piece of crap out it has to be good and true and helpful. Obamacare will make healthcare worse then it is now.

Yes, we have wild turkeys in our garden,(and not the bourbon)! They can fly short distances and go right over the deer fence. They ruined our corn this year. They're not very smart either! If you try to chase them out, they just scatter. It's like herding cats! The fenced part of the garden is about an acer, so chasing them is quite a workout. : / Killing them is illegal though, so we just have to chase them off.

Agreed! So many variables to be considered, I believe a person takes an overall assessment before deciding on a course of action. If these were scenario based I have to wonder if they were fight or flight or feed and breed based (potential life threat or a waitress bring food or a drunk hottie)then there are the types of people tested, passive, aggressive, all male, all female, both? Discovery news didn’t offer any more data, would like to see tests in VR.

Great boots. Grew up wearing them. A beach town necessity.  People would buy more if the price point was lowered. They are trying to make a killing off the name brand.

At this time, I do earn more than my husband in part because I have more education to my husband.  He did out earn me when we first got married, and at that time, he wasn't that comfortable with the propect that I could make more than him.   \r\n  \r\nIt is easy to say it would be great if your wife out earns you when that isn't going to happen in your marriage, but because of societal norms, it can be a real ego blow when it does.  Over the years, my husband has warmed up to situation, and he now proud of my success.  We work as a team.  It is our money, but we don't need consult each other for smaller purchases.  I do expect that we discuss bigger "extra" purchases.  We talked about my glasses before I bought them, but we didn't need to discuss paying for new brakes for the car before we added them.

I agree with that! The record producers in nashville better be made aware that more people then they think, thinks like No Rocker and myself.  More and more americans will not be buying your trash if this type of music continues.  If we want to listen to music that you can not hear the words or understand what the words are, we might just as well listen to something else, but we still would not be buying your trash.

I`m sure it has something to do with the electon. If you look back a few years when Bush was in office just before the election it was under $2.00. Gas is a big issue, You are not going to get re elected making people pay $4.00 a gallon. That is very un popular.

I am tired of everyone blaming the schools for some of these asinine rules. It is because of the public looking to sue school that these rules are put into place. Schools need to protect themselves from parents and the public. When the people of this world remember what common sense is and how it is used, maybe we can eliminate rules like this. Until then we will all have to live with it. We have no one to blame but ourselves.

When I had my first child, a daughter, 11 years ago I did a little research with the consideration that I was 42 at the time. I came across a very interesting study showing that girls/women receive FOUR TIMES the amount of funding for school than boys/men. \r\n \r\nThat study was conducted over a lengthy time period, so if you add my daughters 11 years on top of that 20-25 years is about right. \r\n \r\nI sent this article to my sister. She has two grown daughters and is accomplished, educated and moderately successful, She recently remarried a much more successful man and I feel she deserves the comforts that his wealth provides. She did not become any less accomplished, educated or successful because he has more money. She became HAPPIER. Only because he is a great guy who knows as much as she does about respect in a relationship.\r\n \r\nIn many ways, I am very glad to have fathered a girl. I just dread the upcoming teenage years and spending 3 to 5 times more money on clothes and necessities than an average boy would need. Again, this is a statement of research, but its very simple. Look at what boys wear, then look at what girls wear. Go online and add up the costs. Throw in for makeup (for the girls) and its easy to see. \r\n \r\nSure boys have their down sides too. Like my having to help them with their studies because the money goes to the girls.

The kid didn't die. It was a dumb thing for the officer to do; but on the brighter side it can be considered a lesson to the child to know it would have been worse had he been committing a crime. But it appears obvious the parents are going to use this incident for greed and financial gain.

If a storm can stop society from moving forward then why do people get upset with the turmoil in the world today.  If people think we live in chaos then they should visit other countries. Hati comes to mind. IF the original settlers stopped what they were doing because of a storm then they would not eat... if one felt the race was not appropriate then do not paticipate...   but... but... do not force your will n the masses...

I can't belive the so called journalist who wrote this. ..." the children's experience with this class A drug was postponed by at least a few years." and... "we wonder if some parents would have been happy not to report this "trick" and simply take the spoils as part of the on candy." Does the BBC have editors? The writer doesn't go off on the guy who hands it out but implies the kids will all do cocaine later on in life and and goes on to attack the innocent victims, writing that he wonders if they would take the drugs and use them? What kind of scumbag writers do they have working for them? I'd fire this ****. He seem like he does it himself by the way this is written. Shame on the BBC and MSN for allowing such a poorly writte, accusation filled article.

I think most people just want jobs, and have realized that greedy UNIONS have forced good jobs to go elsewhere!  \r\n \r\nI've seen companies "shut-down" from union arrogance, and their out walking the streets the next day, no job, no pay-chec; "nothing!"  Just like the Bain commercials exploiating the situation for Obama's campaign, my guess is that those people were just to radical to work it out, so,,,,,,"bye-bye!"  There's only so much a corporation can do before YOU force them to close shop!!  Cold-hard facts of reality.  Just like football,,,,,,if someone comes along better,,,,,,"you're gone!"

(Southern MN) Well a similar event with my SRT8 1st year production model Dodge Challenger (2008 426 Hemi) 1st time out of the garage since winter outing in spring of 2011 on way to Future Son In Law Stag Party with my Son along (Me 58 son 30)!  Just went flying by car I was passing on 2 lane Hwy!  Small town up road 5 miles, at time was probably in the 110-120 mph range started to back off to 90 as town coming up! Looked in my rearview = red lights!  Was a sheriff in a UNMARKED WHITE FORD PICKUP (That fair? HA!) Pulled over soon as saw red lights!  Sheriff walked up to car and asked me if I had any idea how fast I was going? Said I had no idea waiting for the 120 figure said 98!  I just said OMG 1st time out, my collectors car as was 3 years old but only 2,000 miles on odometer!  He looked said well Bright Orange/Sport Car what you think "we wouldn't  be watching you!  I just replied "yea I would also if I were you!"  He then returned to his pickup came back 10 min. later and said I am going to write you up for 64 in 55!  That way this will not even be reported to State of MN and/or go against your driving record period!  OMG all I could do is say "Thank You!"  He made a few comments about how much he loved my car and said I can see how it would be easy to be going so fast and not be aware of it, but slow down!  I did held it down to 55-60 that day for 150 more miles! (2 times time to get there? HA) and on way home 2 days later!  Can totally relate to the bright yellow firebird guy!

The Center for Disease Control has issued a warning about a new virulent strain of this old disease. The disease is called "Gonorrhea Lectim." It pronounced "Gonna re-elect em" and is a terrible Obamanation. The disease is contracted through dangerous and high risk behavior involving cranium up the rectum. Many victims contracted the disease in 2008. Most people, after having been infected during the past 4 years, are beginning to realize how destructive this sickness can become! \r\nGonorrhea Lectim is easily cured with a new drug on the market called "Votemout." The first dose should be taken now and the second dose in Nov. 2012. Everyone should be warned not to engage in this type of behavior again; otherwise, it could become permanent and eventually wipe out all life as we know it.\r\nPlease inform all those bright persons you love and really care about.

Amazing. Lmfao. I believe more cops should teach that kinda lesson especially in high crime states, and area. People need to know cops don't **** around. However, cops also need to go back to shooting suspects before seeing a weapon. Shoot to kill, shoot first ask later. I'm tired of good men and women dying.

I only watch Velocity, History Channel, Speed Channel and the Power Block on Spike TV (Saturday Mornings). TV news lost me after coverage of Princess Diana's Death. The TV Shows went south during the writer's strike a few years back.  The ONLY reality TV show worth watching is "Overhaulin'". There are few people in the World that can match Chip Foose when it comes to building custom cars...  I would NEVER watch anything on the major networks. Even the NFL and NBA are terrible now, however you are free to enjoy it! (don't see how though)

why do you all have negative things to say? why are you even on this page checking this out if its so not your thing or country music died so many years ago? Mat you need to re-evaluate yourselves because I almost certain you cant do any better. This is the way these artist live and make millions, what are you doing? I am sure you listen to all those other "so called" artists.

denverBob, whether it's "protected speech" or not is irrelevant in that the current law is you cannot wear a shirt that promotes anything regarding the election. If I wore a shirt that said "Vote for Mickey Mouse!" I would be asked to leave as well. While it may or may not violate the first amendment, these rules were put in place for very good reasons - and I would bet they've been challenged more than once. She was not singled out, with everyone else walking by wearing shirt promoting what or how to vote for, so it will probably stand. However, for anyone who thinks this is a violation of rights and is wrong overall, then I'd suggest finding a way to do something about it.

Akita,  What lie did Bush tell to start the war in Afganistan??  Terrorists started that war in New York and nearly all of Congress and the Country was behind Bush.  He kept us and all of our Embassies safe.  Afganistan was stable when he left office and now it is being overtaken with terrorists again.  It is true that more soldiers have died in 4 years of Obama than 8 years of Bush.

Uh, no. \r\n First, I have to wonder if the children were told how they were clasified as being told you were dull/not bright could result in low self esteem thus less of a social life as time went by and so less of a reason to raise a glass.  That is, of course,  unless the child, now an adult, decided to apply alcohol therapy to alleviate the low self-esteem making him/her out of the norm for the dull group.  \r\n \r\nOn the other hand, are the ones that were classified as very bright now self-confident adults who socialize a lot more or have jobs where there is more socializing and so they consume more alcohol? Of if they truly were brighter and met their full potential then maybe they have a little more $ to spend on booze.\r\n \r\nI'm not sure we got the full story and even when I checked the "SOurce" it wasn't the true source, it was someone's summery of the study.

Signatures are different than your handwriting.  It is the very first glimpse of who you really are.  If you can clearly read someone’s name they are proud and happy with their name.  If you can only read their first name and not their last name, then they like and are proud of their first name and not their last name; or vise versa.  Sometimes women start to “scratch out” their last name when they are unhappy in their marriage or are divorced and never returned to their maiden name.

I'm not sure what everyone is reading, the article clearly says the documents were presented by the union, not the companies or state. It further said that in no way were any non union workers turned away, why does everyone jump at some newspaper article that comes from paper 500 miles away from the incident and was not present?

Well this is nothing new, simply becoming a more = society. More women getting degrees and advanced degrees etc. \r\nWith the economy ttoo many aren't going to school on the male front and they will be selected for a job first. basic sociological knowlodge and reality.\r\nSome men like women who are competitive with them, some want a more old-fashioned lifestyle and there are plenty of women to fill both as well as men to fill the needs for the women who want the same, etc.

Congrarts to Blake. He deserved it. The awards show was very entertaining but as I am from the older generation of true country performers it saddens me top see how much our COUNTRY music is changing. It is more rock and pop related than the wonderful country ballads and songs we use to hear from our performers. I'm not saying this is a bad thing I just feel if it is to be a "country music award" program we should hear more country songs.

Sad I swear people toss the single parent point around like a hot potatoes.\r\nIf your a single parent and cannot spare a tip after spend 100 bucks on a meal then guess what you shouldn't be spending that much cash from the jump. Im a single parent struggling but im not that cheap to tip cause im sure that waiter is just in need of money. \r\nLike my friend said being a single parent doesnt stop you from having fun, being smart, independent.....im sure its also doesn't stop you from spending or paying. Like going into walmart and be like i want this that and oooo this walk out the store sorry im a single mother great customer service.

My husband and I will be celebrating 25 years together this spring and we are still very happy and are still going strong.  For the past 23 years of our marriage I have been home raising our children. My job was 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  My husband has always been very supportive of our (yes our) decision to have one parent stay home with the children.  Since he had the higher earning potential, I stayed home.\r\n\r\nOur youngest heads to college next year so I have been trying to decide what I will do next.  My husband suggested that since I have spent 23 years raising children that I should think of myself as retiring from my first career.  If I decide to go to work I will think of it as my second career.  \r\n\r\nThe point is that we have both always been very supportive of each other.  Marriage takes work but the rewards are great, for both men and women.

Hello Uggs, your prices are toooooo high. I would buy a pair for my entire family but not at $150.00 a shot. And lowering the price to let's say $125 won't cut it. Try $75.00 and you will make money on the volume that you sell.

True Story:  I was hired in 1984 by a major construction company working in California in a union work area.  As part of the hiring process, I was forced to join the local chapter of the Union.  I was last in line on the assignment pegboard to be dispatched to the job site.  Due to the fact that I was hired by the construction company and not the union, an sealed envelope with 5 fresh $100 bills was given to the union chief and I was on the job the next morning completely bypassing the other 400 union hall members.  That is why corruption is alive and well in the unions.  Also it explained why he was driving a brand new Lincoln. \r\n The media is now trying to cover up the truth and the bad news and it is a fact that this story includes: \r\n "WAFF news director Adam Henning told me before the utility's statement was issued the station stands by its story. Ray Hardin, the general manager of Decatur, told  on Friday that officials from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers presented workers with documents that "required our folks to affiliate with the union," which the company wouldn't agree to. It's unclear exactly what that means."

A company should have, in its contracts with unions (as in at-will employment), all of the conditions required by the company to succeed. In addition, and in the competitive spirit of capitalism, the company should be prepared to replace workers, union or otherwise, that do not meet the requirements of the contracts or of the company.\r\n God I'm smart!

16 and Pregnant is REALITY people. I would bet if any of you have teenagers they are not virgins anymore.  I work with DCFS and get calls about under age parents constantly.  Kids having Kids. The youngest was 13.  You need to get your head out of the hole in the ground you are hiding your nieve self and look at reality. Adoption is on the high. Everywhere.  And I will tell you something else. I watch 16 and Pregs and the teenagers making valiant life long choices are more intelligent then some 30 year olds I deal with that only want to work.   \r\nRancic should have taken the hint that maybe they should have adopted or not have kids.  Maybe it was never meant to be.  If she is going to get a nanny or a full time nurse what is the point of being a Mother.  There are more nannies, nurses and caregivers raising children these days then their own parents. Watch the show and let it teach your children to wait until they are ready to commit, that is what it is teaching.

I agree, I have a B.S. in Chemistry and a J.D., I am a licensed practicing attorney and my husband is a police officer.  We began dating while I was still in school for my undergraduate degree and married while I was in my last semester of law school.  While according to this article my husband has "married up", I find this label silly.  We were together for a long time before marrying, and I don't like the idea that education had anything to do with the ultimate outcome.  My husband is a smart and brave man, good father and good husband, even though he works a blue collar job, it is an important job, and the implication of this article is that I "married down".  I don't agree at all.

To bigpictureguy1 and others: (Part 2)\r\n \r\nToday, worldwide, there is an apparent increase in many infectious diseases.\r\nThis reflects the combined impacts of rapid demographic, environmental, social, technological \r\nand other changes in our ways-of-living. Climate change will also affect infectious disease occurrence.\r\n Humans have known that climatic conditions affect epidemic diseases from long before the role of \r\ninfectious agents was discovered, late in the nineteenth century.\r\n[World Health Organization]\r\n \r\nThe earth's climate is driven by dynamic NATURAL processes, \r\n[NOT as some of you say "as god intended"], and these natural processes, when exposed \r\nto excessive human activity produce, and will continue to produce climate change which will ultimately\r\n be detrimental to the human condition. \r\nThese are but a few of the real facts; we must keep an open mind regarding our impact on this \r\nfragile planet, And not succumb to hearsay or superstitions touted by the ignorant many, \r\nwho believe science has nothing to do with our environmental future. Those of you who are skeptical \r\ncan continue to believe others who feel there is no human activity induced climate change, \r\nbut when the first links of all global food chains begin to collapse, and diseases will be \r\non the rise, how will you explain to your grand children that you do not believe in the science, \r\nor be able to explain to them that their generation and their grandchildren will have to deal with \r\nlife altering food shortages, and pandemic infectious diseases!

People need to stop with the overly fake pc bull crap. When there's a blizzard some people lose power and are stranded without heat and their pipes freeze and it's sad for them but another guy gets to ride his snowmobile all over town and has the time of his life. We must help those in need but remember the people who lost their homes will get new homes and they'll have stories to tell their grand children and these times of hardship become a bragging point or a badge of honor that they proudly wear. To say that we have to be solemn about a storm because some people suffered and a few died is like saying don't be happy about your new car because people have died in car accidents. The fact is most people lived through the storm and it could have been worse so marvel at what mother nature has done and lend a helping hand if you can but be happy that everything will get better and this storm will be a part of history.  And take some pictures to show your grandchildren.

The disparity of 'gentlemen' or men who are flexible or 'desirable' men in many situations is what causes women to 'marry down' in some countries in Latin America, according to successful and educated women I have met there. Here- it seems to be swinging in the same direction for similar reasons. Unfortunately, women who are more educated do often have more stable finances and thus more 'choices' of acceptable criteria for suitors. Unfortunately for myself and at least one law professor I read about --- there are con men who build stories to land their 'sugarmom' --- my ex(husband) even explicitly stated to me in one of my final confrontations with him years ago (exact words): "you women sat on your asses for centuries and its our (men's) turn now".  That's after I let my rose colored glasses off and finally was able to prove how much he lied, forged documents and used up any earnings I had made. Oh yes-- he ONLY marries up and has again....

Once I got a ticket for using my cellphone while driving when I wasn't doing anything of the kind.(My phone was in my purse but he swore up and down that he saw me holding it! Well, I don't mind getting a ticket if I've actually done something but I'll be danmed if I'll just meekly pay a fine because some cop was tripping! I contested it and even though the cop did show up the judge dismissed it. So always fight it if you think you're being treated unfairly. At the very least you'll have the satisfaction of knowing you fought for your rights.

Of course companies deny the workers. As soon as a nonunion person shows up to work, and is allowed to work, a union employee files a grievance and the nonunion employee is asked by the company to leave because they can't afford the legal fight.

It is hard if a woman is attractive and has a low cut top on, to keep the eyes focused where they are supposed to be. I can be thinking in my mind "They are just boobs, dont look, dont look, DONT LOOK...and then you look away for a split second and BAM! Right on the boobies! Damn, it is not like I have never seen a pair of boobs, but I take pride in the fact I dont ogle. If the woman is attractive, That makes it twice as hard to not look i mean she can have a great pair of boobs but if she is homely...not a problem. God men are pigs.

I am not keen on either Obama or Romney.....but Obama has got to go.\r\nThe Social Democrats don;t seem to get it. If you are loosing money...STOP SPENDING.\r\nStop creating more government, stop making government responsible for the auto industry, mortgages, and the other " buy outs".....In a democrcacy-republic,  ​  using FREE Enterprise, you take the risk of failure.. When Teddy Roosevelt had BIG BUSINESS busted in the early 1900s because they were monopolies, they had to sell off their satellite businesses. The country did not tank, like it is now.\r\nEurope is a mess because they tried Socialism. IF you have any business associates over there or relatives,,...ask them..... How good is their FREE medicine?...Not too good as it takes an income tax of 50% and VAT taxes to sustain it and other Socialistic programs.\r\nThe Obama administration has robbed our treasury to enrich them selves. Read " Throw Them All Out" an investigative book that describes the $20 million Nancy Pelosi made from her Visa stock while pushing thru bills that favored Visa, and Harry Reid who made a fortune in RE while pushing RE laws. The topper is the $14 billion that Dept of Energy Obama Appointees gave out to Obama campaign contributors. Many of them have declared bankruptcy after having received loans and grants that do not have to be repaid.\r\nI must fault the Republicans, too... We had 12 years of Bush presidents. If there were not in the oil business, they might have worked harder to get us off of foreign oil and more into renewable s. It can be done. Read " Energy Victory" a plan to get us off of foreign oil.\r\nFinally companies are stepping up to the plate and launching commercial space ventures that will actually MAKE money and not be boondoggles like the " retired" Space Shuttle and the now over budget and under achieving International Space Station......\r\nRead "The Case for Mars"....a cost effective, intelligent way to get off this planet and to the only planet in the solar system that can save us when cataclysms come to earth...End of world is not the only reasons to go to space...we can make Billions mining the asteroids and in space tourism...see Spacex and Virgin Galactic.....don't; depend on gov't depend on FREE ENTERPRISE..

This is common in all honesty. When extraordinary factor's are in effect it changes the psychology of people. I work as a consular in the mental health field and this is just a case where reason is suspended and poor impulse control is highly evident. Don't crucify an individual for this. More people do these thing's like this when their environment changes the way people normally act in a society. Case in point is the work that Philip Zimbardo did with his studies on evil. Where normal individuals became rather different when circumstances change.

No one is forced to keep an unsafe worker thus becoming a liability to everyone. That is bogus, if the lead or boss does their job right and documents facts then that employee does get a chance to "straighten" up or face job loss even in Unions...they can be sued just as easily as anyone else. Seniority does not always mean unsafe, does mean a longer term and sometimes older employee, but we can't age discriminate...that'  ​ s a government rule, if the person works for a long period, advancement is a benefit according to the knowledge and expertise put forward, it does or should not ever give anyone the right to remain and be unsafe. I applaud new younger workers into our workforce..they usually are brilliant, better educated simply because of the current eductation system and should by all means advance to equal or surpassed status provided effort and expertise are proven, and by all means in my field they will always surpass us older employees, we harbor no hard feelings because someone can think faster, or move quicker than an aged person, we will all take our turns in that aged arena, just wait your turn.

Just because someone has tons of money does not mean having a miscarriage and breast cancer hurts any less!  Just because she makes a ton of money doesn't mean she should give up her career and stay in the kitchen!  She probably spends just as much time as with her child as "regular" people do when their children are in daycare.  Her and Bill just have the means to bring the daycare into their home.  People accuse her of being jealous of these pregnant 16 year olds, it sounds like you complaining are jealous of what she has!  Jeesh!

Since you are SO positive about quarantining animals (apparently YOU wrote the book on it!).  Here is the excerpt from the local news station from where this occurred:\r\n\r\n "It was hard for Matt when Zion was quarantined last week, after jumping on a pizza delivery driver. \r\n "The lady didn't want to press charges, it wasn't anything serious, but the law has a 10-day quarantine period," he says.\r\n Because Zion was a month past due on his yearly rabies vaccine, he was held for the full 10 days at McKamey Animal Center.

We all have a right to feel what we do, but in the interim I hope the mother has enough use of her senses to file for child support.  Ugly or not it is still his daughter and she did not ask to be born.  The mother did not conceive her alone and therefore she should not be accountable to care for the upbringing of this child alone.  The father must also not have heard that when children are sometimes born ugly, they most times grow up to be beautiful, so if he thinks hes is such an admirable and eye catching individual then he should have given the baby an opportunity to grow into the beauty that he feels he cosmetically has.  But none the less it displays the depth of his thinking, and probably the depth of his beauty.  It's only skin deep!!!!! May God Bless this mother and baby, and with lot's of child support.  When this child grows to be beautiful as she probably will, the mother should pray that God takes over and show this dad how to appreciate being a DAD.   Lot's of Love for this CHILD and MOM

The REAL reason small business does not hire is because of lack of demand due to low consumer confidence-- up to now anyway.  Uncertainty via Omabacare and the Fiscal cliff hasn't got a DAMNED thing to do with it. Ditto for Big Business. They don't hire because they are making a huge profit with the workforce they have so why fix  something that ain't broke by hiring if you are fine with where you are and things are humming along

I think Obama and the fringies should not allow anyone under 26 to work.  That way their habits and their litters of children mindsets would be forged by age 30 and everyone could just live on the government.  The money for this would come from just piling it on the debt, which doesn't cost anyone anything and is just free money.

Terrorists started the Afganistan war in New York and nearly all of Congress and the Country was behind Bush.  He kept us and all of our Embassies safe.  Afganistan was stable when he left office and now it is being overtaken with terrorists again.  More soldiers have died in 4 years of Obama than 8 years of Bush.   \r\n    With Iraq, how can you dismiss that Bush went before Congress first and authorized it?  How can you dismiss that U.S. Intelligence and many other Countries' intelligence said they believed Hussein had wmds and that he was a threat to other countries?   Doesn't it matter that Hillary and others in Congress including Democrats and Republicans believed Hussein had wmds?   Doesn't it matter that we know today that Hussein had murdered at least a million of his people?

To be financially responsible is becoming an ever harder thing to do with the continued erosion of the median earning potential courtesy of ever more greedy elites who forever want to add another zero to their wealth. If one cannot generate a decent income, they are doomed to fail acquiring adequate wealth in their working lifetime and will be reliant on the mercy of the government safety nets. A return to feudal times with the loss of the middle class.

If it were only that easy.  I doubt if Einstein was much of a drinker.  His wife, in answer to why their marriage was such a long lasting one is  quoted to have said, "I know how he likes his tea."

I wear them with mini skirts, jeans, leggings...just awesome. I am sad to hear that I am paying $$ for a pair made in China, they probably cost the company NOTHING to make and they probably paid the Chinese workers nothing. Sad.

Dr. Stu Ostro's warnings, which were uniquely based on his discovery of high pressure blocks that caused Sandy to turn Westerly twice, rather than east out to sea, convinced and led NY and NJ Authorities to evacuate and SAVED A LOT OF LIVES.  Stuart Ostro was ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact Sandy is going to cost in excess of $20 Billion over time, as it clearly wiped away most of the Jersey and Queens/Long Island and Staten Island Seashore Communities.

some of the comments defending puppy mills are just terrible.\r\n\r\ni've seen puppy mill raids where the dogs had mats so bad, the skin beneath them was decaying and maggot infested. but that's okay because people are making a living off of it? people make livings off human trafficking and sex trade too; don't even give me the bs that i'm "comparing humans to animals" blahblah. humans and dogs are mammals. if you can find me a mammal that isn't a sentient being, i'd be really surprised.\r\n\r\nif you want to breed dogs for a living, do it responsibly -- get health checks and screenings for all the dogs regularly, screen the people who are buying them, spay/neuter contracts, etc. don't just put fifteen dogs in one cage for their entire lives and have them crank out litter after litter.

I think the way Bloomberg worded it was incorrect.  I think if we say that global warming increased the probability of this disaster happening it would be better than (a) saying it was caused by it--asking for trouble-- and (b) using the word stupid (I know about the political reference)\r\n \r\nUnfortunately the problem is that we are applying a fallacy when we make these types of claims because without hard data we are basically saying coorelation implies causality.  \r\n \r\nI think informed people should present the issues better to get the common person to think better.  Frame our questions so that it encourages thought rather than bring out biases and emotion.  As Jane Goodall said, "We didn't inherit the world from our parents, we borrow it from our children, but it seems we have been stealing it from them.

Akita,  You might be thinking of the Iraq war when you say Bush lied to start that war.  Doesn't it matter though that Bush went before Congress first and authorized it?  Doesn't it matter that U.S. Intelligence and many other Countries' intelligence said they believed Hussein had wmds and that he was a threat to other countries?   Doesn't it matter that Hillary and others in Congress including Democrats and Republicans believed Hussein had wmds?   Doesn't it matter that we know today that Hussein had murdered at least a million of his people?   I can't speak about anyone motives for doing something but it doesn't matter to me at all if Bush's motivation was related to anything having to do with his Dad.

Together the destruction can be fixed and peoples lives restored. \r\n Reading this articles heading, I thought his speech was going to be a disaster...it wasn't...its a hopeful analogy.

Latest Presidential Polls: Obama Leads Romney By 77 Points in a Global Poll of World Voters  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe World Could Vote is a website  that measures global opinion based on user-generated voting patterns that are then processed and presented in graphical form. Several interesting details come out: Mitt Romney has support outside of Pakistan, and if the world were rational, Ron Paul would be the GOP candidate (granted, I’m still in love with Paul’s foreign policy). \r\nThe site’s poll for the current election opened in the middle of August, and so far, 4,234 people from 102 countries have voted. President Obama collects 3,757 votes, or 88.73% and Romney 477 votes, or 11,27%.

Shot. There USED to be a reward in Texas of $5000 for any dead bank robber; nothing for a live one. When my dad was a kid, there was a lawyer whose office overlooked the bank from across the street. He kept a loaded 30-30 next to the window.  I understand the reward has been discontinued. It was offered by the banking assossiation.

I've been on the giving, rather than the receiving end and I hope the kids will always remember me when they think of Halloween. Let's see.. Last year I offered the kids mashed potatoes. I had gravy and chives and bacon crumbles and sour cream to go with it, but no bowls. The kids would come up to where I had my table set up, just outside my garage door. \r\n"Trick-orTreat!" \r\nI would whip the throw-blanket off the large red pot, revealing my 'treat'. Holding up my ladle, I would ask "Who wants Mashed Potatoes?! Hold out your hands!" The shocked looks on the kids faces was priceless. (Of course I had candy for the kids who were mashed potato intolerant.) \r\n\r\nTwo years ago I gave out big old dill pickles from a jar. Than there was the year I offered the kids canned veggies. (I actually had one boy, a scout, who wanted my canned corn for his food drive; and I had one little girl who wanted my can of cat-food for her pet.) \r\n\r\nIn most years, the kids all want candy instead; except for the year I handed out "Magic Wishing Rocks" -lumps of crushed marble from my landscaping. I told them; you hold the rock in your hands and say, "I WISH I had a piece of candy instead of this stupid rock!" Most of the kids went for the rocks that year, but I made sure they really wanted the rocks because I didn't want any 'returns' in the middle of the night. There were none, and in following years I've had kids tell me they still have their 'wishing rock.'\r\n\r\nThis year I have moved into an apartment complex and didn't do Halloween. But if I had, I would have offered the kids scoops of ice cream in their treat bags, with chocolate syrup and whipped cream. (Again, no bowls or cones or anything like that.) It would have been fun to watch their little gears spin as they tried to wrap their minds around the logistical problems of accepting my 'treat'. \r\n\r\nHalloween is all about the treats, but let's not forget about the TRICKS! I believe in the tricks. But giving cocaine to children is just fugged up! I hope they lock that guy away for a good long time and never let him near children again.\r\n-Science_1

I think it is good that it landed on him, and he survived, than that it landed on some small child and killed him/her.  While the church is clearly liable if the cross turns out to have been a hazard, I think the church should be pleased that he did, quite likely, save someone else's life. Can you imagine the lawsuit if some little child had been brought in to be prayed over, and the little old granny had leaned on the cross and tipped it onto the child?  Yes, the church should be glad that he survived and should settle with him quickly for the cost of his medical care.

I think sweet George said it all when he sang " Murder on Music Row"! I will be the first to say that yes music has changed and there is alot of great talent out there, BUT with that said, most of it, IS NOT COUNTRY!  I do think this show, along with so many other things, have become so political. So much so, that it's almost impossible to enjoy watching it. I've heard so many people bash Tim & Faith? Yet in another breath, we are crrying about losing country music. In their defense, not that they need it, is there anything wrong with wanting to stay healthy? How many women do you know her age who can do a full back bend while performing and never miss a note? Heck, I don't know too many young people who can... Faith hasn't performed in over 7 years! Cut the woman some slack! She's beautiful and along with so many women, I'm sure would like to hold onto some youth. And Tim....simple...How many men his age are holding it all together and still look that good. At the end of the day, they are both human. The world has become so critical. and Really? Willie needs to retire? Yet again....perfect example of a catch 22 ....Do you want country or not? We cry that we've lost country music, yet in another breath, we are trying to push the people who gave true meaning to country music out! WTH!?

When I lived in upstate NY (Saugerties area), about two or three times a season, local police and highway patrol would pull over a dozen or so drivers all at once, issue them speeding tickets (whether they were actually speeding or not), and for those drivers who went into court (and the vast majority did to plead their innocense), the judge would drop their case and charge a $10 to $20 surcharge, payable to the clerk upon leaving the courthouse. They racked lots of revenue that way, and it was nothing shy of mob style corruption. So don't tell me that all ticketing police and their courts in all towns throughout the states are good honest law-abiding outfits. There are several factions of corruption in many states, my upstate NY experience is my only one to make this judgement with.

It's the government, its what they do. they tax and spend our money on useless programs that benefit a few. Back in 1776 we fought a war with England about over taxing and won and we won the next one in 1812. Our forefathers put the second amendment, the right to bear arms in the Constitution so that if the government gets out of hand and think they can ride rough shod over the American public we would have a means to overthrow a corrupt government. Unfortunely a large part of the public is asleep and allowing this to happen or want a socialistic government. I do not

This is 2012.  Have you looked at the cost of teenage boy's clothes?  Or their technology?  There has been a big push to consumerize boys and girls.  I don't think that a similar study in 2012 would show a signficiant of a difference; however, both sexes would have more money spent on them. \r\n  \r\nPS.  I was much cheaper than my brother.  My car insurance was less.  I finished college in 4 years instead of 6 years because I had better grades.  I didn't own a car until I was 22 (in contrast to 17).

To you Anti-Union idiots, Can you not see what unions did for you through out the whole 20th century. Not only building this Nation to the best place to live on this earth, but also the highest standard of living anywhere. Since Pres. Reagen had a spiff with his actors guild union and wanted revenge, the repubs have been after unions ever since. If you cant see whats really going on you should move to some country where the king rules and your the peasent pleading for food and shelter. Its the people with the money, stock holders, CEOs, investers, and wall street that want to take your livelihood from you for the greedy bastards they are. It was unionized workers that built the companys to be as prosperous as they are Now . Those same companys want it all now and if you want a job they'll pay you what they pay in China or Mexico according to the Republicans New World Order. Wake Up and have the forsight to see whats comming your way when Wal Mart and Haliburton decides who your President will be. Stand up for Workers and unions who'll fight for your piece of the pie or be happy dumpster diving.

A girlfriend of mine once claimed that I was the worst driver ever, because I  had recieved 5 tickets \r\nin since I started driving.(no accidents ever) \r\n  \r\n I asked her how many tickets she had recieved and she claimed only 1 parking ticket. (3 accidents) \r\n  \r\nI asked how many times she'd been pulled over in her life. She said,  "I can't remember for sure but at least 7 or 8 times, but I had only got warnings." \r\n  \r\n When she asked how many times I had been pulled over, I said... 5. \r\n  \r\nTrust me, your best chance of getting a warning instead of a ticket is, and I will quote her, "by having a very nice rack and a good attitude." \r\nSorry guys. \r\nI should have had her to define, "good attitude", but I was afraid to ask.

"Contrary to what it seems you believe, although women's neurophysiology results in being perhaps being more expressive or "emotional" than men, more often than not, this does not get in the way of functioning in a career or relationship."\r\n \r\nPerhaps it doesn't get in the way of functioning in a career OR a relationship, however consider that functioning in a career AND a relationship is a different matter. How many men have been kicked to the curb when they couldn't handle both. Probably uncountable. And while some women and some men can handle both, that does not transfer to all of each gender. \r\n \r\nSomehow it seems that it may be you who is laboring under stereotypes and ignorance.

Yes, the FR-S is a good start, but as I have said before, another company offers the exact same car in a better package. \r\n  \r\nThe CR-Z is supposed to be a sporty hybrid.  Unfortunately it isn't sporty and it doesn't get very good fuel mileage. I give them credit for offering the manual, but that isn't enough.  I will give Honda credit for still offering a manual in a lot of their models.  If they ever figure out how to build a car that is fun to drive, I have confidence that the transmission will be the correct one. \r\n  \r\nI almost forgot, Toyota even killed the manual transmission IS.  They seem to be trying as hard as they can to not get my business.

Very accurate description of the lyin Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch a Sketch Champion.\r\nEven lyin Willardo's Mexican daddy knew what he would be like when he grew up So he gave him his first name "Willardo" after the large movie rat. He gave him his middle name after an old baseball glove that they found in the family outhouse that was full of shxt. They shortened lyin Willardo's first name to Willard and their last name from Robberos to Romney when they smuggled little lyin Willardo over here from his birthplace in Tijuana.\r\n \r\nHe is now known by most people as Mitt Robme.\r\n \r\nIt is amazing how these right wing nuts believe that lyin Willardo, in any way is going to do anything but destroy our country again. He is going to eliminate regulations so that his corporate criminal masters can rob and steal from us once again as they did under Bush Bin Lyin and his criminal gang led by President Cheney.

What do any of YOU know about unionism? 99% of you have no affiliation and have no experience to base your ignorant comments and opinions on. Union workers are regular people who were blessed enough to have the sense to stand together for whats right and whats fair. You hate unions and make silly comments about how unions are ruining this nation and are outdated. If you truly believe that you're company cares about you then your mistaken. Read a little history about how workers were treated in this country until the 1930's when "we the people" finally got tired of being bullied and KILLED by our employers. Unionism is about protecting your neighbor and your family. You get rid of OUR right to stand together and they have divided US and then THEY have won. To think that YOU'RE alright with that.... Where are all the free minds and spirits this country once had?

Or does it simply imply that the man still thinks that he should be able to decide how to spend the money? \r\n  \r\nMy husband and I purchased a home two years ago.  My mother-in-law told me that I was lucky that I had some input in the house because she didn't when she got married.  In her case, her father and her husband picked the house.   \r\n  \r\nWhile I bit my tongue, I also knew that we only got the house because of my income.  My husband lost his job right before closing, and we could afford the house on my income because we chose a very small one that we could pay for on either of our incomes.  In mother-in-law's case, she was 22 years old and a stay at home mom who deferred to her husband or father for most everything.  Her father provided the down payment.  In my case, I was 42 years old and had been working for years.  I do think that my mother in law should have included her more in the process back in the 1950s, but there was no way that I would stand for that today.

Buckin Bronco Bama, Commander of shiitt.  After Katrina, people were screaming for help that almost never came.  But, a week before this election, 17 huge Air Force planes are going to the northeast taking trucks, generators, etc. to help the people there.  I am happy the people of that area are getting some help but I hope the American people will see this as I see it.  I see it as buying votes with taxpayers money.  don't get me wrong.  I am happy help is on the way, but I hope it won't get votes for a commander of shitt.  Milk Romney won't send aid because he isn't a commander yet.  Help me VOTE AGAINST ALL INCUMBENTS!

I think it is very arrogant of us to believe that a science that claims the world is hundreds of millions of years old. Then turns around and scoffs at someone asking for five-six hundred years of data ridiculous, and claims that the planet is warming causing catastrophic climate change. can anyone say "the sky is falling, the sky is falling, the sky is fallking". Gives us a 100 million to study thhis for ten years and will save you. Anybody that beleives in climate change out there should call me because I have beeach front property in Oklahoma for sale.

The 1.6 million will pale in comparison to the 500 or so million our government stands to lose when Fiskers finally bites the dust - which will be soon! For they will be yet another in the growing list of bankrupt green energy companies that benefited handsomely from Owebowmao's signature brand of green energy cronyism. And sadly, many of these car companies (like Fiskers and Tesla) didn't even build their cars here in Amerika and imported them!

Why do people always assume Obama was elected by the people on welfare? If he was, wouldn't that say a LOT about our country? Wouldn't that mean that people need to be pulled out of poverty, jobs created, tax laws changed, and welfare laws changed? Please do your homework. Do your research. Realize that the majority of people that voted for Obama were middle class, working, taxpayers.

Another example of being pc going too far.  We do not allow any showing of emotion or empathy and then sit back and wonder why there is so much bullying.  It is time to stop banning every little thing.  I am quite baffled by the hug related injuries though.  Do they head butt each other at the same time?

I agree with ji7144. Milton Hershey was such an admirable man--hardworking and determined, caring and thoughtful. The orphanage he and Catherine started was not just for show. Pictures of him with the children and their continued involvement in the school showed where their hearts were. He would not condone the use of children in this way.\r\n\r\nHe would also be upset at the money saving practice of adding high fructose corn syrup to the Hershey products in America. It was obvious in the ways in which he used the financial results of his hard work for the benefit of so many that making tons of money was not the goal. Making a high-quality product was his goal. \r\n\r\nI have not purchased Nestles since they were involved in pushing their infant formula on 3rd world nations. However, when I look at the ingredients lists on comparative products from Hershey and Nestle I am seeing a much higher quality product from Nestle.

The only reason Hershey was singled out is that the attorneys in this lawsuit feel Hershey has the deepest pockets and the easiest to extort cash from, until the attorneys' pockets are full of this tainted money, then they will quit..  Will an attorney ever feel guilty about being paid in 'tainted money'??  Do cows fly?? \r\nIt's all about the money..  the horrible working conditions are just the vehicle to get at the money..  Will this cure or somehow ease the horrible working conditions??  Do cows fly??

As far as dealing with the cop is concerned, I always claim not to have my insurance papers when asked so that they have that opportunity to write a ticket. My thoughts are that they may be required to write a ticket if they pull you over, so if by law they have to write you a ticket for the no insurance but felt that you were truthful and easy to deal with for the moving violation, then they can cut you slack while at the same time telling their supervisor that they did write a ticket for the traffic stop. Never argue, it doesnt help anybody.\r\n \r\n When I was 18, as part of my hefty speeding ticket fine, an extra punishment was to have to sit in court every wednesday for a month and watch all the court cases. Typically this was a job killer if you had one, but fortunately for me I was off on wednesdays so it was nothing more than entertainment value. Most of the bad kids in town were sitting there, some with up to a years time, and every time they would be hard headed and not show up the judge would add an extra week. It was interesting watching the cases, and how never people defending themselves got off. This article is a flat out lie; you DO NOT WIN fighting your ticket in court. However, if the officer does not show up, then everybody with a ticket from that officer present in court gets off clean. After a not guilty plea, you would hear both the officers and defendants accounts of what happened, and 100% of the time the judge would say "I am going to find you guilty, and assess a fine of ___". Its almost like it was not relevant for the defendant to even utter a word in the court after a not guilty plea, and was more like a "assumed guilty until proven innocent" type of scam. Almost nobody lawyered up and assumed that they had a fair shot in court, but after this experience, I would say its more of an insult to the judge than anything to go to court not lawyered up. This one guy did lawyer up, and his ticket got reduced from reckless driving, to careless driving, and with it going to driving class, it amounted to $35 and no record. The only way to get your ticket reduced or dismissed is to lawyer up, or by shear luck that the officer doesnt show up which you cant lean on. You are wasting your time if you think that you have a fair shot in a traffic court on your own, where both the cop and the judge are paid from the same payroll account!

Um if you kill animals on accident that aren't meant to be euthanized  you don't deserve to be running a shelter. I don't think anyone would sue the shelter but I would most definitely sue the people. There are plenty that can take his/her place. I used to work at an animal shelter and I know how they line up animals to be euthanized, only the badly run, people who don't give a damn would accidentally kill a dog.

You are incorrect about law enforcement being the driving force behind tightening gun laws. Every law enforcement officer knows just about anything can be used to kill someone (i.e. your hands, a writing pen/pencil, a spoon, a shoe lace, etc). Additionaly every law enforcement officer knows not to play any with sort of compliance ordinances. This officer needs some serious remediation; depending on his length of service and training. The same officer that screwed up, might be the same officer that loses his life saving this kid or one of his family or friends in the future. The kid will get over it and his parents most likely will buy a boat or a similar item, and thank God every day for the dumb act of this police officer.

As a newly graduated RN (less than 1 year ago) I do firmly believe that student nurses should be allowed to care for patients, otherwise how would we learn? That being said, they ALWAYS should be supervised by instructors or precepting nurses.   \r\n  \r\nIn our nursing program we were always supervised when giving medications (IV or PO), or doing any procedures.   \r\n  \r\nI still have yet to understand how even someone with no medical training can confuse coffee and IV fluid.  \r\n  \r\nBut what I do know is that if she had any question whatsoever about the procedure or "medication" she was about to administer, she should have asked someone with more experience. \r\n  \r\nI know we all make mistakes, but this mistake cost someone their life.  I hope this can serve as a learning experience for student nurses and seasoned nurses alike.

Well, we know what the little guy WON'T want to be when he grows up. As to Angela, I don't see the disrespect here..except to the children, for whom the officer should have been impeccable in all things in order to inspire the children. Instead, he gave them the heavy-handed, bully stereotype that leave children fearing the people we teach them to respect & trust. Way to go, Angela! Perhaps you could join the officer by following the Taser festivities with another lesson in good role model careers by dressing as Cruella de Ville for a trip to death row at the dog pound.

tRUST IN uNIONS:  you are SOOO correct!!  Majority of people do not understand nor know anything about Unions, and are, basically, controlled by someone in Corporate America.  Unions actually protect their workers to ensure they are, IN FACT, getting paid for their worth and skill, not capped and controlled by the, so called, Market Based Salary, which is how corporations keep the salaries down.

There should never have been a conversation about it to begin with. Your city is in ruins, Staten Island is still pulling out the dead, no power in so many places, no fuel, too many homes not fit to live in, and people in shock. But hey, let's have thousands of people all needing housing, water and resources come and run. This guy will not be re-elected making these kinds of decisions.

Wow, just when you think you have heard every dumb remark he can make he finds a way to conjure up another one.  At least it wasn't another pathetic lie but even that would be better than insulting the millions of people affected by the storm. How belittling he is. Drop his entitled, arrogant, self flattering butt off in Staten Island and let him get to work. That can be his lane.

Typical Liberal immaturity. The country is hurting and has been hurting for four years under the inept Obama Administration and all the Liberals can do is distort Mitt Romney's name or create childish cartoons. Try growing up and acting like adults. Our country's future is at stake and we quite frankly are faced with a looming depression that not even Obama's smooth talk will make it go away. We need real leadership this time around and can not fall for the endless promises of an inept president like Obama.\r\n \r\nRomney/Ryan Serious men to do a serious job.

When you get preferential treatment on College entrance, employment, etc. Its not a surprise to see that some women are now in positions of authority. Men who are in authority dont want career women. Women in the workforce dont want women bosses. Hope this clears up the question which is WHY.

You have made an interesting point.  However, a child on a farm can learn just as well about the company business than to be forced to pick cocoa beans 8-10 hours a day.  Let's pay those farmers enough for those beans so they don't need child labor.  I stopped buying Hershey bars when they started blowing up the volume of candy itself with air and thinking that the customers wouldn't catch on to their fraud.  Bigger bars with less product in them.  How dumb do you think we are Hershey?

What is wrong with these two people....how insensitive could anyone possibly be?  A mother had her 2 and 4 year old boys swept out of her arms during the storm and they were found dead on a deserted street and these two are using backdrops of devastation for a photo shoot.  Maybe they should get out there and offer some help to those people who have nowhere to go.....no homes, no food, no clothes....that would make for a more tasteful way to act.  These are really two sick individuals!!!

Hello Peanut351\r\n \r\nActually, I think you are right.  The long term goals are decided by what is reportedly known as The Bilderberg Group.  Read up on them.  They work through the Council on Foreign Relations and such other organizations.  You will find our past presidents on both ruling parties are members.   So, are presidential elections really just a ruse?   Something to keep us all bickering with each other while they pursue their goals and manipulate the governments and economies?

"Citing the boost it brings to the city's economy, New York Mayor Bloomberg decided to hold the world's largest marathon on Sunday, as scheduled."\r\n \r\nThat's fine, but what about all of the resources that will be used to get the runners into N.Y.? \r\n\r\nThere's enough problems getting gas to people who need it to run generators, get to work, run equiptment to clear debris. They are going to take some of that away to run taxis and rental cars for these folks to come into town? Are they going to make sure there are 3 people in each of the cars?\r\nHotel rooms, yes, but how about food to feed these people? How about clean water?\r\n \r\nFiddling while Rome burns...:(

Studies like this anger me, I am heavily modified and do freak show performances so of course it only makes sense that I have a high pain tolerance and I hate the reaction I get from some men who think I must have blacked out while getting my piercings and tattoos or that while I'm doing my performances I'm under heavy anesthesia. I am not, I hang from thick hooks, shove nails through my nasal cavity, endure having over 20 needles stuck in me, and walk barefoot on broken glass and feel all of it! I would have loved to have taken part in this study and show that I could take more pain than any man! Yet to the answer of the worst pain I've experienced I can not say that I feel physical pain as a disturbance any more, I am no sadomasochist , but  I've learned to accept pain as a daily part of life. The worst pain I felt was in my early modification days when I had a large scarification piece done on my chest, because back then I was not that accustomed to pain.

Whether this story is true or not, the fact is that labor unions are organizations who have outlived their usefulness.  They were originally established to address things like child labor, unreasonably dangerous or filthy work environments, and exploitative or cruel employers.  Federal and state employment laws now address all those issues.  The outrageous demands of unions concerning pay and benefits has a large role in the current uncompetitive and overly-expensive costs associated with American manufacturing, and they have definitely pushed employers to send jobs to other countries where labor is cheaper.   It's getting to where no one but union workers can afford American-made products.  Labor unions in the US apparently can't control themselves, so they need to be outlawed for the overall benefit of everybody (except possibly pampered and overpaid union workers).

YOU DON'T SAY,  ROMNEY'S LYING AGAIN?! \r\nHey TOE CUTTER, how about the big lie when Romney took credit for the auto industry comeback, when all he wanted to do was cut them loose and let them die!!!  \r\nAnd there is NO tax associated with Obama-care, just a penalty if you don't have any insurance. The same exact penalty we have here in Massachusetts for not having insurance, that Romney is supposed to be proud of enacting.  \r\nAnd unemployment would probably have been under 6% if the staunch Republicans that thought about nothing but sabotaging his time in office, rather than voting for the plans he had, that would've helped this country get back to normal. \r\nRomney says he's a job-maker, I remember differently. I was working for the State when he took charge, and 1/3 of the people I was working with got laid-off.  And he cleared out a whole department of people and sent their jobs overseas to a call center.  That's how he made things better here, LOL.

by the way did i say DONT TRUST ANYTHING THEY SAY. CAVEAT EMPTOR< let the buyer beware. especially look for out of state registrations on the carfax and the dates and try to find out if there were floods there at those times. the really good scammers will really do a good job on the cosmetics,new carpet or seats. look under the seats. does it have rust under there. it shoudnt at the metal frame.look under the carpet, find rust run away from theredid they spray paint inside the fendewells or undercoating underneath that looks new run away. does the solid iron parts have flakey kind of rust that falls off in chunks run away. do the nuts and bolts of thing mounted under the hood look real rusty or are they too new be suspicios but you can look up the things to look for. look for rust in the underbody nooks and crannies up above the suspension mounts. look for telltale signs of waterlines or rust lines under the fenders in the trunk behind the liners. look for brand new transmission fluid in them. how many people change their trans fluid? very few. look for new gaskets on the differential housings and brand new differential fluid in them. who changes that stuff? very few. salt water immersion will give all the alloy parts like the transmission, water pump,alternator hosings a strange. pitted look. if you dont know what normal stufff looks like when used go visit your local junkyard and look at their transmissions alternators and other alloy parts. all that stuff has been wet and will not look like the salt water corrosion stuff. you can find pictures of and articles on the internet on salt water corrosion effects and how it looks. also salt water corrosion and rust on painted parts have a unique look to them ask you body shop guy to help you.the loss of possibly tens of thousands of cars from tis hurricane is in the works here and all this JUNK is going to be pawned off on the unsuspecting public all over this country and end up in the junkyard as late model repacement parts too. the money that will be made screwing us on this JUNK will be enormous. the temptation is too great especially in this economy which is already screwed up plenty. DONT GET ME STARTED. this is not supposed to be a blanket covering all used car dealers and junk yards. even they will be screwed when all this JUNK comes back to bite them and they wont want to take a loss but they are much better informed than we are so have an advantage over us.we will be the ultimate losers and tis JUNK will be out there for years if not decades.

First of all red 62 I am still married!! You should read the post a little better next time.At 45 years old I think I have seen enough marriages fail to know\r\nwhat there is to gain and lose in one.When a women reaches a certian age and feels time is slipping by(which means all her friends are going ther own ways) they suddenly all want kids. I also have seen men trapped(myself included) with women who suddently get preggo on purpose.And trust me,when a women gets pregnant at 18 thats an accident.But when they get pregnant at 30 or so they know exactly what they are doing.!!  Now I realize all marriages are not this way. But when it does end the man will get the worst of it.

There is a VAST difference between the two.  Your comparison between milking cows and forcing children to work at gunpoint is completly different, in case you can't see the difference.  Your comparison is ridiculous at the least and makes you sound like a horses ****.  Regardless of "expecting their young children to go out and keep the goats from being eaten by lions" or anything else they may do, it does not mean we do or should approve of it or condone it.  Whether you consider "us" in the USA (I don't know where you must be from, but I sincerly hope it isn't from the USA, and if it is, perhaps it shouldn't be since you think so little of us in the USA) to be sissy's because we "feel" for children a weakness just shows how very much of a horses **** you really are!  Try to climb up from the rock you live under and see what human beings are capable of...

I ask again, is the Earth going to explode, is the Universe going to implode -- just because the criminal Chris Brown got "dissed" by these Irish rappers? Anyone whose lives revolve around this "news" really need to get a life.

I wouldn't expect a hollow headed E! host to understand the emotions a pregnant 16 year old goes through. Girls that get pregnant at that age do not plan to get pregnant, it's almost always unexpected and a shock to them and the people around them. There are lots of complicated emotions that go along with pregnancy at this age and I'm sure it is hard for girls to get excited about having a child with such a whirlwind of emotions swirling in their heads.

I wonder how much of the drop in sales had to do with SB 1070 signed into Arizona law?\r\n\r\n "Economic Sanctions Committee of Somos América is asking every Latino in Arizona to boycott Budweiser. Their support of the boycott is a response to Hensley & Co.'s, Budweiser's distributor, financial contributions to political supporters of the anti-migrant law SB 1070 who continue promoting a climate of fear, hate and criminalization towards the Latino and immigrant community."\r\n\r\nRemember, Cindy Hensley McCain, wife of Senator John McCain (R) had a huge share of Budweiser stock.  \r\n\r\nMy take, though, is Budweiser is too expensive, compared to other beers of better quality.  I liked the commercials, but I wonder how much people are paying to see those ads?  Plus, I'm no fan of the McCains and don't want my money going into their bank accounts.

Dumping the current government will take at least one more generation. We want experienced people but they all come from the same pool that the current polititians come from. They all take the same path so they all get the same dirt on their feet . A fresh start is gonna require some grass roots recruitment.

The Center for Disease Control has issued a warning about a new virulent strain of this old disease. The disease is called "Gonorrhea Lectim." It pronounced "Gonna re-elect em" and is a terrible Obamanation. The disease is contracted through dangerous and high risk behavior involving cranium up the rectum. Many victims contracted the disease in 2008. Most people, after having been infected during the past 4 years, are beginning to realize how destructive this sickness can become! \r\nGonorrhea Lectim is easily cured with a new drug on the market called "Votemout." The first dose should be taken now and the second dose in Nov. 2012. Everyone should be warned not to engage in this type of behavior again; otherwise, it could become permanent and eventually wipe out all life as we know it.\r\nPlease inform all those bright persons you love and really care about.

Ewwwww..... Isn't nothing more disgusting in this world than a man who appreciates trashy-ness as a way of life.... SuperBeast is a boy who lacks morals, guidance, values and ?????  His teenage years were dispersed with dope frenzies of freaks trying so hard to fit in with the lower class society of cockroaches.....He and his friends probably made games of such a task... Like firing BB's at little critters on the wall and then betting themselves to lick and eat them...He was 13 the day he felt up his Best Friends little brother..... The little brother had no earthly idea what was manifesting in the wicked and diluted mind of such a travesty of a person... The little one ( Only 4 at the time) thought it was normal for another boy to be playing with his willy....SB progressed into one of the most serial pedophiles of our time.... He gives dope to children after cooking such a tray of ICED Candy.... It's the only way he can touch a cocoa starfish

I love my 2008 Yaris.. My car is rated for 29 mpg city and 35 highway, but I've never actually checked. Either way, I only fill up once every week or two and still only pay about $35 each time--it's much better than the car that lasted me through most of college, a 1998 Ford Taurus that got maybe 20 mpg.

AP Article: Romney claims government will shut down if Obama is re-elected.\r\nAnother: If Romney is elected (11/06), things start changing 11/7.\r\n\r\nI don't know about you... but those two statements sound like TERRORISM to me. First, if the Party of NO blockades us any longer, you can expect WAR. Second... the new President isn't sworn in for several weeks. He can only "act" 11/7 if he is- Obama.\r\n\r\nRomney is a FAILURE. He was never qualified to run and continually trips over his tongue. Can we REALLY afford a massive IDIOT like that? NO. VOTE NO PARTY OF NO and NO ROMNEY.

Now that Hershey's dirty little secret has been exposed, why would anyone buy their candy? I already boycott several name brands due to the conditions in their third world factories. America wants cheap goods. So do I, but not at the expense of poor women and children living in slavery and working in something less than subhuman conditions. I will do without chocolate unless I can verify that it meets "RAISE THE BAR" standards. I will do without the clothing made by underpaid, underfed workers, I will make do without many things and some times I will make a mistake because I am not infallible. I ask others to boycott with me because it works and as compassionate people, we must try. I live on a fixed income, some of you are poor, some of you are upper-middle class and some of you are rich. It doesn't matter because as a nation we have proved that we can overcome any challenge. BOYCOTT HERSHEY PRODUCTS! BOYCOTT HERSHEY PRODUCTS! BOYCOTTHERSHEY PRODUCTS!

Although I was divorced I did have some good years.  Ironically, the good times were when we were not so rich, and things fell apart when we had a lot more money.  My parents had a long marriage, stuck through thick and thin.  His parents were divorced.  I think one's parents have a lot to do with it.  He was quite insecure as a result.  Maybe I felt sorry for him.  There was never a give or take.  We are both good people.  We just do not travel in the same wavelength.  Happily married people or good friends understand each other without having to explain.  The understanding has to be there.

You really know nothing of Obumer care or Insurance companies.  Obumer care totally supports the ins companies by retaining the walls between interstate commerce in place.  And on top of that makes 90% of those that will not buy insurance now buy it.  And ins premiums will keep going up.  So Obumer care did nothing for Americans.

The stiitching around the soles came apart and neither the store I purchased them from nor the UGG company customer website or phone number I contacted  would ever contact me. GUESS THEY REALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!  If this company goes out of business maybe it will teach other over priced brands your customers are your LIFELINE. Make a good product, don't over price it and if you get a complaint..RESPOND!

, no home inspections are not paid for by the seller but you can make them pay to clean up/fix whatever the problem is, or at least reduce your offer to include the price of cleanup on your dime. When i bought my house I had to pay the inspector to come out and look at the property, based on his review I then placed an offer on the house of course at a lower price than what was being asked because of the things brought up in the inspection. This gave the sellers the options to accept the offer or counter the offer by fixing/addressing the problems listed. If I choose not to accept their counter offer I could have walked away and done it again at another property and all it cost me was an inspection that came to $250 ....It is not the sellers job to reaserch your new house it is your job and again when you are paying $36k for a home worth over $100k it becomes a "buyer be ware" situation.

I am 51 single mom with a 15 year old son.  I am also disabled my disability is my hands and elbows, and just this past July 1, 2012 after 6 months of begging the lafact ndlord to put handrails on the front porch I had the honor or great misfortune of losing my balance and next thing I know I being care flighted to Dallas TX ( 100 miles to the south of me). I  am the proud ower for life of a plate 7 screws and 3 pins. I was discharge on the 3 the day I get my check. (i had never recived a lease from him) well he up the rent 200.00.  So just as soon as I could fine some one to go to the Dept. of Human Services and turn in the new rent amount, 4 days later my worker called and told me that my food stamps were going from 197.00 to 167.00 because he was going to enclude the eletric in the 200.00 rent jump. I bring in 1018.00 a month for my son and myself to pay everything.  His dad and still my husband had been our life line. Without him I know for a that there would have been many nights without food. To my son and I Jello is a luxuie item that we do not get very often.  MY SON AND MYSELF ARE SICK OF BEANS AND ROMON NOODLES.

All kitties and doggies are cute. \r\n  \r\nIf you go to Hawaii, and someone says that they need to "go shishi" or "go shi-shi," in Pidgin it refers to the need to urinate/pee. In Japanese, "shi" is the number 4, and "go" is the number 5. So, another way of expressing having to urinate/pee/go in Pidgin is "5-4-4." \r\n  \r\nIn Japanese, I believe the word "Maru" refers to a big ship on the ocean. Any time one sees a Japanese freighter or any other big ship, the name always said "(Name) Maru." \r\n  \r\nI'm not sure what "Shishi" means in Japanese, but in Hawaiian Pidgin/Japanese, "Shishi-Maru" could be interpreted as "Pee Boat." \r\n  \r\nWhen I was a kid, a neighbor couple had a cat named "Sukoshi" which means "little" in Japanese. That's where the expression "A skosh" meaning "A little" comes from. \r\n  \r\nI suppose it's Hawaiian/Japanese trivia day...

Just to be clear, I'm a man, and all men are NOT like the man you described. \r\n  \r\nOne of the things my wife says she loves about me is this -->  When we were dating, and someone would ask if we wanted to go somewhere or do something, I would ALWAYS turn to her and ask what SHE wanted to do BEFORE I RESPONDED. \r\n  \r\nToday, our marriage of 20 years is a TEAM EFFORT.  We share responsibilities, and support eachother when one of us is "down". \r\n  \r\nThe good guys are out there -- we are the GEEKS and NERDS that most women snub.  We know how to treat women respectfully.  We are also the men who will be engineers and "techies" and make lots of money.  Don't discount the geeks!  :)

Obama is incompetent and it is Easy for a talent like Trump that must lead to manage an empire of real estate like he does. Obama has never done a budget and never managed anything more than his rent check. That is obvious when you see he has never done a budget which he is legally responsible for the country. "Incompetence showing, at every turn but what do you expect from a guy that has never done anything other than campaign. He cannot even find his transcript of where he attended college. He does not know where he was born or if he is legitimately a citizen and has others keeping watch over his personal information so no one finds out anything about him unless he tells it the way he wants it known and it changes from time to time. He has totally failed the United States and will soon have us in World War III with the lack of leadership he is exibiting in Libya. He has bungled a secret Arms deal he was doing with the rebels in Libya and allowed 4 Americans to get killed to cover it up. We are all going to pay dearly if he is re-elected as he continues to allow the debt to grow to an unmanageble state and againd due to his lack of experienced and incompetence.

Of course President Obama did not respond too quickly to Sandy.  It looks to me as if during this crisis the President has been able to think on his feet and calmly and quickly lead the charge, something most folks are happy to see from our political leaders and government agencies such as FEMA.  Unfortunately, some right wing politicians and supporters would rather see across the board failure in order to to gain poltical advantage. Furthermore, what is truly despicable is that some of these fanatics would go so far as to accept a certain amount of human loss of life in trade for poltical leverage.

I know a guy, a friend, who turned down work as a pipe fitter for my dad because they were non union.  The starting wage was 25.00/hr, but they didn't contribute to his pension, so he turned it away.  I'd give his name and city, but that wouldn't be fair as a friend.  The company my dad works for may not pay into an employee pension, but they offer good medical and 401k matching.  Union thugs brainwash their members to think Union or the highway.  No wonder we can't fix our infrastructure with that mentality.

A source in the Deutsche Bank claims that in 2008 our financial and monetary system completely collapsed and since that time the banking cartels have been "propping up the system" to make it appear as if everything was fine. In reality our stock market and monetary systems are fake; meaning that there is nothing holding them in place except the illusion that they have stabilized since the Stock Market Crash nearly 5 years ago. \r\nThe Deutsche Bank informant says that the cause for the bailout of the banks was a large sum of cash needed quickly to repay China who had purchased large quantities of mortgage-backed securities that went belly-up when the global scam was realized. When China realized that they had been duped into buying worthless securitized loans which would never be repaid, they demanded the actual property instead. The Chinese were prepared to send their "people" to American shores to seize property as allocated to them through the securitized loan contracts. \r\nTo stave this off, the American taxpayers were coerced by former US Treasury Secretary Paulson. During that incident, the US Senate was told emphatically that they had to approve a or else martial law would be implemented immediately. That money was funneled through the Federal Reserve Bank and wired to China, as well as other countries that were demanding repayment for the fraudulent securitizations. \r\nAll the money that those banks claimed they needed to avert collapse was also sent to the Chinese to add to the trillions of dollars lost during the burst of the housing bubble on the global market. \r\nThe only saving grace has been the US dollar being the global reserve currency. However, now this prop is showing signs of wear as foreign nations like China, Russia, India and Iran are dealing in gold as currency and purchasing gold on the market at an exponential rate. Their use of gold as currency which has threatened the direct value of the US dollar as the global reserve currency.  \r\nThe war with Iran has to do with gold, its use as currency and its exposure of the central banking cartel’s lack of gold which defines a fiat currency’s worth. And right now, the US dollar is absolutely worthless. \r\nSince this time, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in conjunction with FEMA and other federal agencies have been quickly working to set in place their directives of control under a silent martial law. \r\nSusanne Posel’

How come all of a sudden khloe is using  kartrashian instead of her married name Odom, that she was using since she got married.  I guess there are some people who don't know who Lamar is.  Don't watch any of those talent shows but pictures of khloe showed up on the computer and from what I could see, both outfits looked horrible on her.  Come on - can't she afford a bra??  Lamar has to be sooooo embarrassed.   Wonder what Kim will do to get attention back to her again.  Why can't they all just go away.

A woman already has a tremdous amount of power in a marriage because of her vagina. Add being the major breadwinner to that equation and you have the makings for a divorce rate that's thru the ROOF! Interesting, that studies have shown that men have a higher percentage of adultery who are married to women who are more educated/higher income.\r\n \r\nMy guess is  it's very demasculating and men try and regain there sense of power in other unfortunate  ways.......sad!!

This is TOTALLY TRUE. Ethanol is a SCAM, which was foisted upon us consumers by the Oil and farm industry to increase sales of what would otherwise by wasted corn by-products that corn farmers couldn't sell. Ethanol LOWERS MPG in every car that uses it. It is a fraud and scam.\r\nWhat angers me, is that is allowed to continue without consumer consent or control.\r\n \r\nOne other thing- despite having lower EPA posted MPG numbers, it IS possible to get much higher gas mileage in every car, You MUST use the right kind of Synthetic oil in the engine and transmission, and watch how you drive in the cities and highways.\r\nNever drive fast up hills, always coast downhill, never drive faster than 55 on the freewways, and you'll get the high MPG's that were promised to you on the sticker.\r\nIt's not that complicated.\r\nAlso, when sitting at a stoplight for more than 30 seconds, turn your car off. It's a waste of gas to let it idle for that long. You waste a gallon of gas for every hour you sit at a light idling your car. That is a proven fact.

The show over all was well put together. However, the sound was terrible all that seamed to come across was the music and non of the words.  I agree that most of the show was focused at the younger generations, rather than the loyal real country fans.  which is why the star such as Reba were not performing in the show.  I'm glad that in the state I live still offers a classic country station for those of us that know country can still listen to them on a quick or long drive.  Thank God we have I heart radio too.

Like an alcoholic or drug abuser might need multiple times in a rehab or relapse, so often victims of abuse have the same issue.  It is a learned thing.  Victims of abuse so very often were raised in homes of abuse or were sexual abused as children.  It is very often all they know.  They are so use to the chaos, that they do not know what life is without chaos and drama because they have never lived that way.  The other side of the coin is that they simply want to believe that “he will never do it again”, because that is what the abuser promises.  We all “see” things as “we are”; how “we” think.  Step out side of your self and walk in the other persons shoes and see their life and walk a few miles in their entire life, then you might actually see things in a new light.  There is a dynamic, piece of puzzle here that you are missing.

What the article fails to address is that women marry up to educated men for one reason only, money.  More education usually means more money.  And more money means they don't have to work after a divorce.  The alimony is an insurance policy women hedge a marriage to a higher educated man.  They want to be taken care of for life, even after a few years of marriage.  Simple fact the female author missed.  Look out for Kristen Wong feminine slant to her articles.

Thinks, just because the first 3-6 months are rough doesn't mean it's not worthwhile. If you want to be a doctor, you have to put in the time to make it through school first. If you want to be a world class gymnast, you have to suck up a lot of painful injuries and training. These are just examples off the top of my head, but the point is, just because there is a time period where a decision makes your life on the miserable side of things, it doesn't mean that decision won't reward you 100 fold a short time down the road.

Myth #4:  Since global warming occurred before we invented SUVs, it can't be caused by man-made CO2.\r\n\r\nFACT: This myth sounds compelling and is among the most common myths, but it's really just a garden-variety logical fallacy.\r\n\r\nP->Q =/=> ¬P->¬Q\r\n(P implies Q) does not imply (not P implies not Q)\r\nThat one thing (P) causes another (Q) doesn't imply other things can't cause it (Q)  as well.  Somebody else posted a good analogy.  If you see one guy in a cast, who broke his leg playing baseball, do you assume that every guy in a cast must have broken his leg in baseball.  If you see another guy who broke his leg climbing a ladder does it disprove that the first guy broke his leg playing baseball?

I fired all financial advisors as soon as i retired as they are pocket pickers. I do very well with dividend only stocks. No personel insurance either. If my adult children can't manage their expenses it is not my place to pay ther bills (excluding hardships beyond their control)

Ryan, you're an indolent freak that knows nothing about budgets, but presents an imaginary front of wisdom to all the citizens and the fools in the House of Representative that you lead so well, you are the head guru of the worthless Tea Party. You are pushing our country closer and closer to the greatest deepest Cliff.You only know distorted political policies very well for the benefit of the rich, you burst your lungs with the lies you produced in the House of Representative giving these speeches about how to annihilating the old, and later will hurt the younger people by taking their Medicare away in the notorious Vouchers replacements trick. Also trying to change the present Social Security to “Privatization”, transferring those billions of dollars presently in “Secure Government Funds” to Large Banks, Money Lending Institutions, and “Private Investor Groups”, if the Stock Market were to crash any time in the future! The money will just disappeared in the pockets of all last mentioned institutions. You, like Mr. Romney, thinks that the 47% of our best citizens are worthless. These 47%, they are the ones you both want to take everything away from them, while they are trying hard to recover from the Bush destructive years in power. If you both by a misfortune and stupidity of the American people get both of in the White House, you both will destroy America as we know it! Keep thinking no one, but the rich deserves all the millions of dollars, all the food, all the houses, all the comforts of living, home car elevators, all the health insurance, all that obtained from the sweats of the middle class presently working for you now!! Ryan, you keep  attending Congress, while you also running for VP, and sleep there all day, besides voting against every Bill to abuse the American citizens that you both call the 47%, and the rest of the 53% you are screwing-up also! Mr. Ryan, people/women are criticizing you because enjoying showing your muscles, and taking athletic poses during you lousy speeches. To many of us, you eyes face looks like the night owl my grandfather kept, the poor bird flew away into the unknown, never to return! You should do the same! You have the Hercules verbal, and mental complex, the gift and ability to lie to anyone that wants to listen to all the junk that comes out of your mouth, needing daily wash with cleaning fluids to sterilize your mouth from perpetually telling, and propagating political policies full of lies to the decent American people all around you!

All pathetic, psychotic, braindead right wing radical cracked teanut dopes should listen to your leaders. They warned you about the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger during the primaries when they were able to tell he truth about this moron.  \r\nLyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch A Sketch Champion may have vision of going back home to Mexico.  \r\nAll braindead pathetic right wing radical cracked teanuts should listen to your leaders.  \r\nRick the Dick Santarium has brainwashed his followers, the evangelicals and the gay rapist, pedophile catholic priests that lyin' Willardo is a member of an evil cult and is the anti-christ. He also told them that lyin Willardo is the worst person in history to ever run for the presidency, can't be trusted and will destroy our country. Groper Nutquist, the boss of the right wing cracked teanuts and Nut Gingerhead, the criminal lobbyist, totally agreed with the last three assessments.  \r\nSo most of the evangelical sheep will probably stay home on election day or some may even vote for Obama. They are totally scared to death of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch A Sketch champion.  \r\nIf this repuke draft dodger ever became president, and war broke out in the middle east, he will be putting his dog on the top of his car and fleeing to his birthplace in Tijuana and hide in one of his 4 grandmammy's (pappy's side only) outhouses.

A new controversy for Mitt Romney......Romney Made a Fortune Off of Extorted Delphi Government Ransom Payment \r\n  You wouldn't know it from the way Paul Ryan has been championing retired non-union workers of Delphi Auto, but his potential boss – Mitt Romney – made a mint off of a hedge fund investment that sent most of Delphi's job overseas and hedge fund principals who blackmailed the government into a huge payoff. \r\n Greg Palast has detailed the ugly story on Truthout (reposted from the Nation). It is also the topic of a United Automobile Workers' (UAW) news conference in Toledo, Ohio, today, as exclusively revealed in a BuzzFlash at Truthout piece by Palast, "UAW Charges Romney With Profiteering From Auto Bailout." \r\n Ryan is claiming to be upset  that former non-union Delphi workers are not getting full pensions,   which is grotesquely ironic considering Romney made a career of pension destruction that was part of his vulture capitalism formula.  Remember also that -- which is Palast's point about Delphi -- the Romneys are still earning more than some 20 million a year in their "retirement" based in large part on investments in firms that cannibalize industry and workers. \r\n Romney's likely multi-million dollar profit is hidden in Ann Romney's so-called "blind trust." In 1994, when Romney ran unsuccessfully against Ted Kennedy for the Senate, Mitt declared:  “The blind trust is an age-old ruse.”   \r\n Did Mitt Romney Break the Law by Failing to Disclose Delphi Investments? \r\n http://truth-out.org  ​ /buzzflash/commentar  ​ y/item/17617-romney-  ​ made-a-fortune-off-o  ​ f-extorted-delphi-go  ​ vernment-ransom-paym  ​ ent-tell-paul-ryan

musiclover88........  ​ ..................th  ​ ink.  What is the American Bar Association?  What is a Republic as in the Republic Of Rome?  Templars who used God's trinkets to build a Republic of Bankers who then used those trinkets to lend money to Pilgrims migrating back to Jerusalem, did so at a profit--thus there was no propheteering but profiteering.  The U.S is in debt by consumption made easy through lending with the expectation of repayment--this is against the very Evangelicals (Mark, Mathew Luke and John) by which the very Constantine Bible disavows, yet the Vattican got rich lending money accrued by the tithing plate...............  ​ ........the use of the temple for commerce and the erection of false icons before God is the Free Mason's rite.  This is not the time for lessons of mankind's fall from grace.  This is the time to listen to your heart where God resides in the good men who put aside their thoughts of sin and live in the moment for God.  People matter..............  ​ ..........everything  ​  else is semantical for the lawyers and false prophets to make money adjudicating.  Right now, lives dangle on the vine................  ​ ...winter and cold and starvation and death is knocking everywhere.  Now is the time to Unionize as Moses unionized the Jews who were led to freedom by one of the Pharaoh's own.................  ​ .............Moses.  Moses was the first Union Organizer and he did so at a great cost to himself.  Pharaohs and Kings and Emporers cannot enslave a soul if there is none to pull their blocks of arrogance and egotism!

I am in agreement with this article, but especially about housing.\r\n\r\n When my husband and I were younger and he was retiring from the Navy we chose the cheapest, smallest home in a very nice subdivision. \r\n\r\nWhen we bought our home the sales price was all the money in the world. There was even a short period of time that he and I were both unemployed! We went without a lot of things during that period.\r\n\r\nFast forward 17 years and we'll soon own this great home. We were able to provide our son with a comfortable, safe home in a good neighborhood and access to good schools and great teachers.\r\n\r\n Ours was the house that all the kids came to after school which is priceless now that I look back on the fun we had when he was small.\r\n\r\nI grew up in an NYC housing project and know all too well the issues surrounding growing up in an unsafe, violent environment. Carrying pepper spray and a switchblade at 12 wasn't what I wanted for my child.

Guess Mitt's plan didn't go as expected!\r\n\r\n\r\n"A private equity company run by fervent supporters of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney bought the third-largest voting machine company in the country last July.\r\n \r\nH.I.G. Capital is a Miami-based private equity fund that manages $8.5 billion in capital. Hart Intercivic is a company exclusively in the business of manufacturing and programming voting systems. \r\nH.I.G. Capital's co-founder, Anthony Tamer, previously worked at Bain & Company. Eight of the company's managing directors came from Bain as well. H.I.G.'s directors have collectively given so much money to Romney that their company is the sixth biggest contributor to the Romney campaign.\r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\nOne of the jurisdictions with Hart Intercivic equipment is Hamilton County -- which includes Cincinnati, the third-largest city in the hotly contested swing state of Ohio."

This article and Fidelity's formula discussed in it are precisely what is wrong in America today. To even suggest that in order to be comfortable in retirement one must save up 8 times one's final anual pay is so far out of touch with most Americans that it would be laughable if it weren't so disgusting. But does anyone really care? Of course not, and more than likely this is just some number that Fidelity has drummed up in order to get more Americans thinking of investing their money (in Fidelity funds of course). \r\n8 times one's final anual pay...geez. For what it's worth, I earn almost $100,000 a year and I will be lucky if I have saved up $100,000 by the time I retire (if I ever even can).

If Mr. Hershey was alive, I'm sure his head would be spinning.  It is an absolute shame that a U.S company could use child labor especially when Americans complain how parents treat their childern here.  You always read articles about how this parent spanked their child in public or this poor child doesn't have this and that.  We're concerned about children here but not concerned about children in other countries?  A child is a child to me regardless of where they are. They should be in school and enjoying being a child. How about Hershey try to find a way to grow cocoa trees here in a monitored environment that closely resembles climate conditions in Africa?  I mean, we're trying to grow everything else in a lab, why not trees?  Why not try to be dependent upon ourselves rather than dependent on other countries?  I refuse to buy anything else made by Hershey!

Mitt says something dumb and you libs are all over it calling names and saying vicious things but are perfectly willing to have Joe Biden be president.. He says stupid offensive things every day(never reported here though). \r\nLiberals are selfish and only want what they want today and don't care about what may happen tomorrow or later down the road. They certainly don't care what kind of a nation their kids and grandkids will inherit.

The days of someone simply graduating college with any degree and expect to replicate these old-timer career paths is OVER, DONE, FINISHED, NO MORE.  Stop disillusioning your kids with your stories of how it used to be.  Today's world is about quantitative and specialized skills.  If your child does not pursue a degree in engineering, science, medicine, accounting, finance, and the like, their chance of being able to obtain a comfortable middle class life is greatly diminished.  People on here post how they're making $100k per year now, but how long did that take?  20 years?  25 years?  30 years?  Hey, it's almost time to retire!  Professional degree holders can do it in about 10-15 years after college.  THIS is the new reality and continue to be even more so.  Asians and Indians know this.  It's not that these people are taking over our jobs, but rather, companies need these skills and our kids don't have it.

Really sick to death of all the reports of cops tasering people that don't need it. They killed a 110 lb 17 year old kid in my town that was like a son to me. His birth mom sued and LOST.  Apparently 4 cops with tasers on one kid that was vomiting and then unconcious (and then brain-dead) before they stopped was "within reason". What was the kid doing? Standing on a street corner holding his bible and yelling for Jesus. Those cops knew the kid and his dad, knew he had problems and decided to get him out of their way for good. Murder, pure and simple. I think they should take away the tasers and give the police their guns. You didn't hear that much about cops shooting unnecessarily before tasers. \r\nWhat would I have done? The same as FTEE and Daniel D.

I got a ticket once and went to court.  I was towards the end of the line so I got to see what everyone else said to the Judge.  Everyone had excuses or lied about their driving records....all go points and fines.  So, when the Judge asked me if I had anything to say, I said "No Sir".  I got probation before judgment.  I can't remember if I had to pay the fine and court costs or just court costs, but it was definitely worth it.  The officers take notes at the time of the offense and will tell the Court if a driver was argumentative at the time of the ticket.  Just be honest and humble.

You "Get a CarFax" believers are so naive. A CarFax report is no guarantee that any and all damage will be listed. The flaw is the vehicle in question has to have the damage reported to the insurance company to get reported on CarFax. CarFax offers no guarantee that their information is correct and will not cover you if the information they supply is wrong. All you get is a warm fuzzy feeling. Get any used car inspected by a professional that you trust. A CarFax report is not a substitute. Any good dealer will be happy to allow this inspection. If not keep looking.

I see a lot....but ...what I see is all from folks who have "opinions".. I have raised 2 WOLVES..have let a wild BEAR and a wild COYOTE out of traps..and had the darn animals get out about 15 feet and turn to me as if to say thank you.. Animals do understand a lot more than you think. When I was a kid on  Staten Island..a woman raised a BLACK LEOPARD... The City made her give it up - and it wound up in the ZOO.. Every week-end she could -- that gal would lay in that cage with her big cat...Never a problem.

First of all you don't get "hauled into court" for getting caught working non union when you are a dues paying member. You sign a contract stating that all work you do will be under a union contract and you will not do anything to compromise the integrity of the union. So if  your buddy got caught working non union while carrying a dues receipt he would have charges filed and asked to go in front of the Examining Board which is a panel of other workers like himself to hear the charges and decide if he is guilty / innocent / or partially guilty. Nobody is going to court. you are saying stuff about things you don't even have a firm grasp on. Who are you to spread lies and spread bias opinions? I am on an Examining Board. I know what I'm talking about. DO YOU?

A good friend of mine, former Police Chief in a California city in the L.A. area, once explained to me that you almost can never talk your way out of a ticket from a motorcycle cop. Traffic is all they do. \r\n \r\nThose in cars deal with a much wider variety of law enforcement issues and are more likely to be a little more flexible.

this may be a bit off subject, but, im sick and tired of cops using tail lights,  "not coming to a complete stop "  no turn signal " when no ones around,  and various others BS excuses to pull you over.  The reason they do this?????  for those of you that dont know.  its illiegal just to search your car.  so they make up something , or follow you until you finally do make a mistake, and then pull you . Then they can legally search your car.  I mean, if you try and argue with him,  who wins,  ??  when you go to court and tell the judge you did totally stop at the stop sign,  who wins?    The police just couldnt follow the law so now they try and find ways around it, even though they are the law.  I wonder how they would feel, if i pulled them over, told a lie about why, and then searched their vehicle why their wife, and baby was in the car.   I buy house and rent them, thus ive been in some less that luxurios neighborhoods.  Ive been pulled over three times like this.   Even had to wait for dogs to come one time . Luckily my baby wasnt with me this time.   So they searched, then said goodbye,    Guess what>> didnt get a ticket any of the 3 times even though in the beginning they said I broke the law.  3 times no tickets??    Its sickening.  I really feel bad for the folks that have to live in some of these neighborhoods.  Heck , they didnt even write a warning.  CAn you guess why??   Because it was a farce from the beginning.  They never had ANY intention of writing a ticket to me.  They just wanted to circumvent the law. I call that breaking the law.

Proven scientific fact that our brains are wired with "mirror-neurons" which hone in on the neurons firing in the brains of other people around us.  This could even be explained by electro-magnetic-ind  ​ uction.  But even in these instances, if the person you are trying to "read" isn't firing the right neurons, you aren't going to get a positive result.  I don't believe in "psychics", but I do believe some of the "psychic" phenomena is true and has a real scientific explanation.  If the subjects of the study weren't thinking actively about what was trying to be picked up, which would almost have to be the case in a truely scientific study (double-blind experiment), then of course the psychics would fail.  Also, only testing 2 "psychics" isn't a very good sample size.

And, he really thinks he is saying something.  What an insult to those in the Sandy wake.  The football stadium wasn't distroyed and you didn't organize it and it's a far cry, no it's on the opposite end of the spectrum than losing your life, your family,  your home, your business, not getting to work.......Wow, he thinks he is getting in touch with  people.  He is so out in left field he wouldn't know what a football  or baseball field looked like and imagine him flying over the Jersey shore, he probably would think it a video game and go home.    If he gets in I'm really worried.  He doesn't see what he is saying, that's so scarey, no reflection, no thought, no nothing.  An empty shell  The comment asking whether there are any undecideds after this comment makes me wonder what education we are giving to people.  Whatever school Romney went to I wouldn't send my kids.  Not with that kind of thinking,  What is it that makes people deny the obvious and follow this guy and the far right radicals.

Don't know about all that.  About a year ago my wife and I were visiting my family at Fort Lee, Va.  Admittedly I was over the speed limit when the cop stopped me.  The only reason the fine wasn't as bad as it could be was because I was 1 mph below the "danger" speed.  I was so nice to the cop that he actually apologized for giving me the ticket and led me to where I was headed. BUT I DID GET THE $320 ticket anyway.

And conservatives vote for someone who's simply a rubber stamp for Norquist. From a speech by Grover Norquist.\r\n  \r\nAll we have to do is replace Obama. ... We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don't need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. We want the Ryan budget. ... We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don't need someone to think it up or design it. The leadership now for the modern conservative movement for the next 20 years will be coming out of the House and the Senate.\r\n \r\nThe requirement for president?\r\n \r\nPick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become president of the United States. This is a change for Republicans: the House and Senate doing the work with the president signing bills. His job is to be captain of the team, to sign the legislation that has already been prepared

Where the heck was the country in this show?  What everyone commented on was so true!  That was pop/rock n roll, not that it's bad, but they don't do country when they call themselfs hip hop.  C'mon people, bring in the country music if this is what it is.  Waylon, Patsy, The Judds, George Strait, Willie, Freddie, Marshall Tucker, Reba, where are you?  Even Elvis sang country and didn't tweek it.  Don't go down that road you new artists.  Blake, don't cave in to the new country, keep it Country or call it Hip/Hop stuff.  I miss the true country stuff.  Carrie Underwood looked amazing by the way.  So did Faith Hill and her man.  Wow!!

You guys seem to be frozen in cult of the past. A good replica does no harm to the original. \r\nConsidering price and availability of real ones it makes sense to revive the glory with a replica. \r\nBut it has to be done right with good chassis dynamics, drivetrain, ultra modern brake system, \r\nand reliable,powerful,ef  ​ ficient engine. For $ 275K it sounds possible to do. \r\n  \r\nTheir "new" body looks just right, but garden variety chairs in brocade will have to go ! \r\n Waclaw.

As a member of a generation between you two...Greg you should really look into the Granny/McDonald's case before trying to use that as an example. If you'd actually seen the pics of the woman's 3rd degree burns, you'd change your tune about that case...I know I did. I have to agree with both of you. Having brought it to the store, she had a reasonable assumption that the employees would conduct themselves in a professional manner and not shared her personal photos. But this world is not always filled with professional and moral people, knowing that, the girl should have deleted any sensitive material before turning it over to a complete stranger.

I grew up with kids from families with 12 or more kids. One family had given birth to 18 kids, (two died in separate accidents) and they were all very well behaved and orderly families. I think what the show is supposed to teach us is that love conquers all and the practices that the Daggers use do work in raising good and productive citizens. That said, I agree with the writer that this show has run its course and should be cancelled.

Good for you Guliana,  I agree.  These young girls who get pregnant at 16 have no concept of what they are getting into.  Many go on public assistance and society pays for their irresponsibility.  Take this show off the air.  It glorifies irresponsible behavior.  Unfortunately most of these girls do not have the maturity to put the child first.  Unless you have gone throught the stuggles to have a child,  you can not imagine how angering watching these stupid girls and boys can be.  Being a parent is a privilege and a responsibility.  It is not a means to fame and attention.  One does not have to be married to be a parent but you should have a job and a means to provide for your child without expecting society or your parents to carry you along

The ancient Chinese would laugh at our petty arguments against constructing defensive structures to protect our EXPENSIVE assets from the elements.  I seem to recall the Great Wall of China was built by hand.  Not including the threat of if you refuse to work you die like was the life in China back then, but it does show what humans are capable of doing when we all define a purpose that something has to be built.

Not per say. I think they should do a little more testing to verify that they will work, then the government place an order and give them a bonus incentive to finish sooner. Heres to hoping they get these to work and inservice soon. Very cool idea.\r\nThat and that the goverment or governments will actually be smart and use them. Like when you see river towns putting up thousands of sandbags but there are these giant easy to erect barriers that are filled with sand by front loaders that can create much better barriers when trying to make large temporary blocks vs using lots of little sand bags, they still seem to be overlooked. Army uses them for easy to build protection and barrier walls too.\r\nI think its time

To draw a parallel without mentioning names, every year certain US colleges protest the making of Adidas, Rebook, and other shoes in "sweat shop" foreign labor factories. Years ago, I saw a report that claimed to make the shoes, pay the import fee, pay the athlete endorsement fee, was about 6-$7.00 a pair. We pay BIG bucks for those same shoes and as far as I know nothing has changed. Visualize this, if Hershey get's it's beans in that fashion, what about Nestle, Cadbury, and all the other chocolate companies. I used to live in Harrisburg, been to both the old plant and the new one. Here, they maintain the highest standards. Forced child labor, slave labor, knowingly, kind of hard to believe?? The folks there in Africa might be doing that? The issue is can we stop it and how. Who else has cocoa beans? What the heck? Let's just destroy another American Icon WITHOUT PROOF. I would suggest that if you feel this is true and Hershey won't address it-----stop eating chocolate----they're  ​  all doing it.

I worked for, and relied on, tips for 7 years of my life. But I certainly didn't get my panties in a twist if I got stiffed. Why? Because I was the one who chose to work in a field that paid a crappy hourly rate!!  You are NOT entitled to a tip. Not everyone tips. Period. And that is their choice, just as working in a job that forced me to reply on tips was MY choice. I decided that I didn't want to work for tips anymore, so I got an education. Again, MY choice. \r\n\r\nPeople need to accept responsibility for their own lives, not blame other people. Don't like relying on the kindness of strangers? Change your life.

I am non-partisan, I support gays, abortion, socialized medicine, but also guns, free speech, an aggressive foreign policy, zero tolerance for terrorists, and financial responsibility. The bottom line is I don't like any politicians, and under US law am not allowed to vote, even though I live here. That is called taxation without representation.

So basically this CEO is stating that they fudged their testing to get better results using a different test method than the one the EPA recommends. Basically, the were caught lying and now he's back peddling to cover himself. And, as usual, our government won't do anything to punish them. The wealthy get more wealthy and the poor and middle class (soon to be the poor) pay for it.

Had it in CA;  'for comparison purposes' is EXACTLY what they ARE for!  And ONLY for comparison purposes.  Are they usually accurate according to how you drive?  Probably not.  But comparing how YOU would drive one model compared to how YOU would drive another model, the comparisons would be valid, approximately enough.  There are MANY factors affecting MPG....tyre pressure, gasoline quality, altitude, is the driver 'riding' the brake, etc.  MPG ratings ARE useful for COMPARISON purposes.  But expecting to attain those same figures in real world operating situations is not realistic.

I don't think this artcle is what Dawkins had in mind as to what a meme is. This is just one model acting stupidly. From Wikipedia:\r\n \r\nA meme is "an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture." A meme acts as a unit for carrying ideas, symbols or practices, which can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate and respond to selective pressures.

My mother was a waitress, and before going back to school that is how I supported my family as well. Tips are part of the salary, and right now most servers make about $2.81 an hour, and the tips are to bring it up to and/or surpass minimum wage. \r\nMost waitpersons do not have any benefits, and they need to hustle to get that money.\r\nFor our household the rule of thumb is, if there isn't enough money to tip, there isn't enough to go out to eat. \r\nI am not saying a server is entitled to a tip, because there are some pretty bad ones who most definitely do not.\r\nRunning up a tab and not paying a percentage to the server is one thing, but trying to stiff someone  by crying single parent is just ludicrous! My mother was a single parent, and I am as well: that woman needs to get her priorities straight!

Tiocfaidh:  Do you find that statement so far fetched?  As an RN, I've seen parents take their children's ADD meds, (like Ritalin), etc,  That statement is not meant to be a joke, only to reflect on our parenting skills.  There are MANY who would take the cocaine from the kids, and never report it, using it themselves, instead.  A sad but TRUE supposition.  Do You really think not?

Patriot 8208\r\n \r\n50% of college graduates are not finding work to answer your question.   This is a disgrace to our country.   I have read that 59% of  minorities age 25 and younger are unemployed.   58% of the workforce is employed now.  There are fewer people employed now than since 1984.  500,000 American manufacturing jobs were sent to China within the past 4 years.    I am an Independent and voted for Romney/Ryan.    4 years is enough for the current administration.

Thank you for sharing some of your money tips on eatting healthy. But it will not work for my son and me you see, if you do not work then you are entitled to that 225.00 per month. but if you have any type of income and even if you only have about 63.28 left over for lets gas, things you would use in the bathroom, dishsoap. oh hey car insurcene.  pet food (we were once told to get rid of our pets "I told them they were with us before I became disabled and I will go with out food first to feed them" they shut after that.  I am just glad my son was not with me.  When I have to figure out a way somehow to keep our son from feeling that life delt him a bad hand.  Oh by the way for two people (yes that's about what I have left over on the 3rd THE BILL PAYING DAY)we get to eat on a 1.32 yes you saw it right 1.32 for the 2 of us and that is for the entire day. Oh boy oh joy. The person who gave the infromation to the reporter did give it to in part correct buuttt ooooohhhh soooooooooooo miss leading.  Not every Man, Woman and Child that recivces Food Stamps gets that 225.00.  To me that looks like a million bucks. And one more thing I will go without food give upfor days so we can buy that box of brownie mix.  The stuff to make homemade popcorn ball. And my favorite Fudge. Tis the holiday season. And I will not let go of the tradistons that my husband and I started with our son.

Quotes out of context do not refute the actual science of global warming; the National Academies says global warming is real and most likely due to human influence.\r\n\r\nQuote mining - quotes out of context by actual experts, irrelevant quotes, quotes by non-experts or pseudo-experts - are the hallmark and zenith of the science illiterate denialists' "research" paradigm.  But what else can a science illiterate denialists do, but pretend to do research?

If she can't tip, she shouldn't go out to eat or she can order something cheaper.  I worked as a hostess/bartender for a while, did my best, and still had a few non-tippers.  Yet, their glass was always full and I always asked if there was anything else they might need.  It hurts when one is trying to survive and has a child at home to support.

The songs sung at the award shows (CMA's) should be the #1 songs that made these country singers...STARS!  I love Faith & Tim, and especially Kenny Chesney....but their song choices were not good.   I was very dissapointed with Faith's singing, and bad songs....what has happened to her great singing?  Kenny...really?  He is soooo talented, but not that song at all.  Always love The Zac Brown Band!  I didn't like Miranda's new rock~n~roll song...turned the TV volume DOWN thru many non-country "POP" songs.  Kelly Clarkson's weird dress was awful, not flattering at all.  I didn't like Hunter's song....he sounded like he was trying to mimic Rascal Flats.  I love the song "Pontoon!!!"  I love the beat...it makes me want to dance!!!   I miss the REAL, true, COUNTRY songs....I didn't hear very many last night.  I love Willie.....so glad he was awarded for his years of great singing!  Good show, just not enough real COUNTRY songs.

I wondered the same thing.  The only people who could sustain "hug-related injuries" are people with broken ribs, people who bruise easily, people who hate being touched, or someone with any other kind of inury that makes it hurt to be touched.  In general though, I would rather kids hug each other than slap, hit, punch, kick, etc. each other.

I understand your point, maybe you need more personal space- everyone is different. so  when you are faced with the situation, just extend your hand out and say, 'no thanks'... that'll stop them from hugging you.  You might not get a pleasant greeting from them ever again.. but that's up to you.

Well if there wasn't young girls with this additude I guess there wouldn't be any baby's to adopt for the rest of the world who can't have children due to some medical problem.... There is also women out there willing to have a child for someone else which is one of the hardest challenges in life...(being pregnant). So it goes both ways.... we got to appreciate the negative that ends in positive for some.  I also feel that the adittudes of young girls with children change as they are forced to grow up. I was 17 and pregnant and if it wasn't for that experience I wouldn't be who I am today. Not everyone is famous...Some of us in the world have a big role of just being mother. It's the most important job in the world. Sometimes it takes raising and getting to know your child and love him or her to realize how much it really means....love just doesn't start when you get pregnant...Love is a process and we shouldn't just have baby's for our own wants and desires either....when you have a baby its not about you anymore.....

Comincents...I know about the lack of training in the Non Union sector as I have first hand worked with former Non Union employees and trained many, as they became members of the IBEW. These, and there were many, Who by their own words said.."I wish I had the training the Union provided you. THis is the major reason I left my former NON UNion employer,  for more access to quality training and better wages". Incidentally the adage from Romney about more jobs is CRAP, if you believe him then I've got some FINE beach front property in El Centro, Cal. ROmney will put people to work if YOU want to work for less than the current minimum wage, until he and the other ilk from the Republican party find a way to decrease the minimum wage. Romney is for "right to work for less" Wake up Comincents you and others are being fed the "koolaid"! From my vantage point the crossover of knowledge from Non Union to Union was dismal. In many cases to train these NEW members it required going back to the basics of Ohm's law and how to read a tape measure. Where as a UNion member coming on to a job, any job could assimilate the requirements of the work from verbal instruction with little to no further oversight. \r\nAgain before you [comincents] spout what you obviously know nothing, try walking in OUR/MY boots.

MSN Money must be short on stories. The best advice for getting out of a ticket is to not break the law in the first place.  That being said, I am a fast driver and have gotten out of many tickets.  One officer asked me why I was speeding and I replied "because I didn't see you" He laughed and told me to slow it down and have a good day.  You have to remember that officers are humans with lives, families and problems just like us.   Another tip for interstate driving is to go no faster than 7MPH over the limit.  Allow 2MPH for error of the radar and almost all state police will not bug you for 5 MPH. Also stay out of the left lane, Left lane is for passing only and they love to enforce that everywhere.  I was going 10 over on 81 in VA and I was in the right lane, a trooper passed me going just a little faster but he kept on going.  These officers don't like to be held up so let them fly on by.

@Angela: How would it feel someone hurt your child?? would you think the same way around? as mentioned by many this is a deadly weapon ESPECIALLY to a child, besides  avoiding to shoot it in the first place. I would imagine how his parents would feel and react to such an incident, it must have drove them mad to see what happened to their kid - and why should the boy obey him to clean his car !!!!!!!!!!! he's showing off in a stupid was and should be punished for extra stupidity and lack of responsibility - what if the boy was rude to him or insulted him in any way (he just said no)?? he would have placed a bullet in his head then !!!!!

He's a really good man, with excellent values, the marathon at least should have been delayed.

The Mayor needs to remember that, when he loses the next election.

Hey - if you want to hear country........ look up bluelonesome.com or check them out on facebook. They are pure country - not any of this stuff we heard last night. If they are ever in your area, be sure to go see them. They are GREAT!!! I, like the rest of you I get tired of not having country music to listen to. I would like to have heard Willie do Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain - but guess they would not give him the time. The best song of the evening was when Carrie Underwood sang Connie Smith's song and Brad played the "acoustic" guitar. That was good clear music and you could actually hear her sing!!

Jim J,\r\n  You wrote in this article......"Maybe someday -- after another devastating natural disaster of two in other parts of the country --the United States might invest in ways to prevent damage to its infrastructure....."  ​   Do you think talk of investment in infrastructure might be a reason for businesses and business owners to pay more in taxes?  Our businesses and entrepreneurs benefit greatly from infrastructure which has been paid for over the years by Americans....ALL Americans.  This is what Elizabeth Warren meant when she said that the current batch of wealthy Americans did not become wealthy due to their business acumen alone.  The wealthy benefit from operating inside a system which had been built and maintained long before they were even born.   There are many places to look for reasons why this has happened. \r\n\r\n I was glad to see your reference to lobbyists and special interest groups.  "Instead, we're going to slash this program and spare that one based on which interest groups yell loudest -- and which groups have contributed the most to the politicians who are best placed to influence the decisions."  You are sounding like a Democrat now.   I am not sure if your politics tend towards higher taxes for the wealthy along with diverting spending to projects which give ALL Americans a return on their tax dollars.  More for infrastructure and less on the Military Industrial Complex would be a good place to start.  I want to see us get away from being a Super Power based on military might and become a Super Power based on economic strength.  That means we will have to take the risk of losses at home.  This risk could be called the potential for collateral damage in our war on terror.   The less people fear us the less likely they will target us.  This would mean politicos would have to stop frightening the American people in their quest to get votes.  This approach would take COURAGE.  The challenge is to stop spending most (not all) of the hundreds of billions of dollars that most politicians tell us that we need to "stay strong".    Are we, as Americans with a history of being brave, ready for a challenge like this?   I think we could be.  I hope we could be.  The groups that want to see us fail want us to keep spending our money on things that don't help us economically such as a military which is spread throughout the entire world.  That is why periodically they put somebody on a plane with explosives in his shoe or in his underwear.  Their cost of doing this.   $1000 maybe?  Our cost to react to it.  Hundreds of millions.   Stop the madness!

Such a retarded argument. I didn't realize "place arbitrary excuse here". That's an attempt to play stupid and get off in a legal system that allows it. How about the woman that spilled hot coffee on herself while driving and sued mcdonalds because she couldn't drink coffee and drive at the same time. AND WON. The cop was/is dumb and needs to be fired immediately. His argument proves how stupid he is and I think natural selection needs to take its course on this cancer to human society.

You can define a man by his character Obama & Biden have none. – here is the proof. \r\nOhio is a key battleground state and all of the candidates have campaigned here during the past months.\r\n \r\n Biden had a rally in Copley in August, Obama had a rally in Fairlawn in Sept, and Romney had a rally in Cuyahoga Falls just last week... these three communities are all within a five mile radius of Akron.\r\n \r\n The cost of the Biden rally was $10,549 and Copley sent a bill to the "Obama for America" campaign but never received a penny.\r\n \r\n The cost of the Obama visit was $34,166 and Fairlawn sent a bill to the Obama campaign but has never been paid either... this cost excludes a $21,304 additional cost for the Akron convention center which the Democratic Mayor of Akron donated for the "privilege of hosting a sitting president."\r\n \r\n Romney's campaign visit? They contacted Cuyahoga Falls in advance, organized the plan, and promised to pay any extra expenses the city would incur. The city sent them a bill for $7,050 and the Romney campaign promptly paid it in full.\r\n \r\n Quoting the Mayor of Cuyahoga Falls, "I think it's self-evident who is accountable for their deeds and who isn't, who's accountable for their actions and who keeps blaming everyone else."\r\n \r\n Indeed, there's a stark contrast between these candidates.   \r\nRomney/Ryan 2012

Mr. Bloomberg, a political independent in his third term leading New York City, has been sharply critical of both Mr. Obama, a Democrat, and Mitt Romney, the president’s Republican rival, saying that both men have failed to candidly confront the problems afflicting the nation. But he said he had decided over the past several days that Mr. Obama was the best candidate to tackle the global climate change that the mayor believes contributed to the violent storm, which took the lives of at least 38 New Yorkers and caused billions of dollars in damage.

I agree with her.  I was an honor student, planning for college with prospects for an athletic scholarship.  I became pregnant at 17.  It's no walk in the park.  My parents were good, attentive supportive parents.  Their parenting did not affect my actions.  \r\n The show is irresponsible and the girls who go on the show need to go to counseling.  They need to make proper choices for themselves and their children, what ever those choices ultimately are.  \r\n My parents supported my decisions, but not my actions.  I took responsibility for myself and my child.  I worked, finished school and graduated on time with my high school class.  I worked, I bought a home, I raised my son.  I am 45, my son is now 26.  He was an honor student and went to a very nice 4 year college that I skrimpped and saved every penny to send him to.  No outside help.  I figured it out and worked for anything we had. \r\n People need to be responsible for themselves and the choices they make.  Quit putting your life on TV for the whole world to review and  critique.    This whole reality genre needs to stop, it's ridiculous, a train wreck everyday for those willing to participate and watch.

ROFL --  I say that a lot  \r\n  \r\nalthough I would imagine if you could find a woolworth's wooden nickel -- given out in lieu of 1-4 cents of change, and taken by the store as good as 5 pennies in trade.  \r\n  \r\nThe antique road show on PBS would have some idiot say it could bring in $10,000 at auction if you had the right buyers there. \r\n  \r\nOne day they had a walking cane that was made from timber taken out of the independence hall in philadelphia and had one of the thirteen slugs cut out of the Liberty bell in order to try to repair it 100 years ago mounted at the top of the cane. \r\n  \r\nThe slug from the liberty bell considering you can not even touch the liberty bell and it being only one of thirteen such slugs must be worth $50,000,000 if Custers flag he flew at little big horn is worth over $5,000,000 having been sold for that at auction. \r\n  \r\nThe guy said the cane was only worth $32,000 I almost called up the show to find the owner of the cane and offer the $32,000 even though I only had $16,000 in the bank at the time. \r\n  \r\nthat show gets prices so wrong.

I think that, in a situation like this, luck plays a significant role.  I was only married for six years.  Unfortunately, my husband developed cancer and passed away at the age of 40.  I always feel a little envious when I read stories like this.  I cannot imagine what it would be like to marry someone and actually be blessed enough to grow old together.  After all the challenges we faced together with his disease, I'd like to think that we would have lasted for as long as this couple.

State Police are very good...they work the roads well and are not mean to drivers.  I have a lot of respect for the few that have pulled me over.  Actually...we need to get pulled over as there are periods when we do nothing but speed...so we do need to get checked, and observe the limits...\r\nI drive a limo here in Colo...last Sunday I did 385 miles...all Denver airport related...lot of miles...and the only problem is that I am under the same 12 point system as an old lady who goes down to King Soopers and back home.\r\nThis is very unfair, as my road exposure is 100 times more than her's.  So we need to change the system to what used to be called a Chauffer's License...with 15 points as the limit.\r\nBut just watch your speed...don't be in a hurry...or you will lose...and you will pay.\r\nCSP...thanks for a great job...and a fair one too !

No, they're not "good quality".  I worked at Nordstrom, and every year, customers would bring their expensive UGG boots back because of poor quality - unraveling of the stitching, can't wear them in the rain, they stain easily...there are MANY more cuter boots on the market than these monstrosities!

Mr. Burns' endorsement pitch \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTop Five Worst Obamacare Taxes Coming in 2013, out of 20 tax increases as part of Obamacare.  \r\nNancy would not let anyone read it until it was voted on. \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Medical Device Tax – a $20 billion tax increase: Medical device manufacturers employ 409,000 people in 12,000 plants across the country. Obamacare imposes a new 2.3 percent excise tax on gross sales  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare “Special Needs Kids Tax” – a $13 billion tax increase: The 30-35 million Americans who use a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) at work to pay for their family’s basic medical needs will face a new government cap of $2,500 (currently the accounts are unlimited under federal law, though employers are allowed to set a cap).  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Surtax on Investment Income – a $123 billion tax increase: This is a new, 3.8 percentage point surtax on investment income earned in households making at least $250,000 ($200,000 single).  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare “Haircut” for Medical Itemized Deductions – a $15.2 billion tax increase: Currently, those Americans facing high medical expenses are allowed a deduction to the extent that those expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI). This tax increase imposes a threshold of 10 percent of AGI. By limiting this deduction, Obamacare widens the net of taxable income for the sickest Americans.  \r\n\r\n \r\nThe Obamacare Medicare Payroll Tax Hike -- an $86.8 billion tax increase: The Medicare payroll tax is currently 2.9 percent on all wages and self-employment profits. Under this tax hike, wages and profits exceeding $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married couples) will face a 3.8 percent rate instead. This is a direct marginal income tax hike on small business owners, who are liable for self-employment tax in most cases.  \r\n\r\n \r\n23 million out of work. 46.7 million food stamp recipients. Fewer Americans working today than Jan 2008. 16 TRILLION deficit. Obama gotta go!!

The media is too lame of a thing to be basing your decision for voting on... in either direction. It's full of sensationalist overexaggerations and focuses on things such as Romney's nominated VP Ryan's washing dishes. Really? Who cares? News organizations take hold of "stories" where there aren't any real stories. In the end, I find both candidates to be boring, stupid, repetitive and not at all exciting. I'm so not looking forward to this election or the next four years. In the end, I can't even care who gets elected.

With three teenagers driving at one point I became familiar with the solicitation letters from lawyers that arrived in the mail to inform me one of my sweet children had gotten a speeding ticket. All were speed traps and none were over 9mph over posted speeds. I discovered that by using the cheapest lawyer and have them plead faulty equipment(speedomete  ​ r), we could get the ticket dropped for payment of that offense. The insurance never saw the ticket and rates didn't go up. I essence it is just a shake down: City/county gets their fee, lawyer gets his fee, no driving infraction for the driver. I made the kids pay me back which teaches the lesson. There is no limit in NC to plead this way as long as it is a minor speeding violation.

Oh I see, it's okay to take the comments of an intelligent , accomplished conservative woman out of context in an attempt to dismiss her as an irrelevant blithering idiot. Talk about a "war on women" LMAO.  Yeah I guess Michele is no Sandra Fluke. Sandra Fluke is a heroine to the left; a Georgetown law student who apparently has a very active social life. Sandra Fluke begs for free birth control b/c she 's having sex so often(instead of hitting the books) and doesnt have the intestinal fortitude to ask of her partners to help take responsibility. MIchele Bachmann on the other hand, became a lawyer while she mothered 5 of her own children plus a number of foster children. But to the sheeple on the left, Michele Bachmann is a clown. So much for "femninism".The left in its typical biased spin doctoring. Please refer to the foolish who apparently fall for the predigested pablum of the state-sponsored media and whose intolerance is transparently reflected in the following posts <eyeroll>

As many have said, go after the cop on civil and criminal charges. What he did was malicious to say the very least, and showed a gross lack of good judgement and common sense! \r\n This guy needs to be fired, at once.\r\n \r\n Sue the cop, but don't go after the police department, not unless they try to sweep it under the rug. This cop is a bad apple to be sure, but what good does it do to go after the police department who have people on there who do an exemplary job.

Labor laws can just as easily be undone.\r\nWitness how easy it was to institute NAFTA, et al.\r\nWitness how effortless it was for the Rs to push through Gramm Blilley etc.\r\nWitness how smooth operators can just yell "Muslim" and "not born here" and how many are inducted into false beliefs, without bothering to investigate them.\r\nWitness how many are turned by simple slogans and engineered phrasing.\r\nWitness how much is gained financially to the top tiers using "shock doctrines". \r\n\r\nYes, labor laws are the codified results of the society's willingness to set things right and assist labor to share in the fruits of their labors.  But they can just as easily be abrogated should our collective incentives be poisoned, such as is happening now with the campaign to denigrate public and private unions, not to mention  public employees and especially, teachers.  \r\n\r\nVigilance is still key to maintaining labor rights and protections.

I felt like the show was more of a Rock-Pop concert than a "Country Music" awards show.  It was the CMA's, correct?  I felt like Brad & Carrie were "off" a little bit - missing ques and pitchy at times.  Why does Carrie need to change outfits EVERY time she is on stage.  A little too much if you ask me. And as George Strait once said, "Whats up with all the smoke and lights, and smoke" during performances.  That too me is a whole like "Rock n Roll".  What happened to being on stage with your voice, guitar and band?  Now lets talk about the Kenny Chesney song.  I particulary did not care to watch him on his "yacht" and his currrent girlfriend.  Tacky Kenny....very tacky.  \r\nI also felt like the sound system came through very soft at times.  What is up with that NBC?

Most cars now have a instant fuel mileage gauge, they also have an average.  To say that you had no idea what kind of mileage you are going to get is stupid.  Also there is a huge difference between freeway mileage at 55-60 than at 70-80.  I have gotten better than sticker with my last three cars.  Not all the time granted, but it was achievable.\r\nI think in the future you will see more cars get better than sticker mileage.

These numbers have been used for decades and multiple presidents.  While I agree, that the numbers have some intrinsic problems, they are useful for comparing data year to year. \r\n  \r\nIt is hard to compare the data for available workforce.  This number is being calcuated, but stay-at-home-moms, early retirees, and the like make it even more unreliable.  In good times, the former examples are often higher than they are in tough times when everyone who can tries to work. \r\n  \r\nRepublican - I'm shocked and dismayed at your language and hate.  You need to get control of yourself.

I guess I have to quote an old Freddy Fender song, "Wasted days and wasted nights" , because  last night's show was a waste of time.  If they want to sing pop or rock, sing pop or rock,  and label it as such. What was on tv last night was in no way country.  I'm sure Patsy Cline and Roy Acuff are turning over in their graves because of  what country music has become. It's really sad. Ever wonder why "Oh Brother where art thou?" did so well, as well as their concert album?  It's because of the people that are starving for true country and bluegrass music. There is such a lack of it today. Bring back the old Allison Krauss and Union Station, playing and singing REAL country and bluegrass, Ricky Skaggs, and the sweet harmonies of Vince Gill, and the Cox family.  You rarely see these folks on the awards show any more. Why? Maybe because they love country like we do and they are aware of the lack there of. Can't blame them for not wanting to be associated with the likes of this "New country." Thank God I've still got some old cds to listen to. Cds of when country was country.

Dont worry!!, i am Argentina and I think that sinse i have memory all the Presidents have been drunk and  took too much drugs the day that they deside to change something in our Constitution. This is ridiculo, like all the desicion that all the presidents had have in Argentina. The problem is that Argentina has not EDUCATION. and the sistem educative is a joke, until we dont think how to change that , Argentina always will took the most increible desicion.

I would have asked one of the teachers to assist in asking the 10 year old boy to move away from the police car. \r\n \r\nBut, we also have to teach our children to obey when a request is asked of them …. We as adults recognize that the word “NO” is a negative used to form structures indicating that something is to no degree or in no way the case or conveying the general notion.  We also are aware that NO is often used to express refusal, denial, or the negation of a statement just made. \r\n \r\nI am not taking sides only to say we should also look at the parents and the past history of this 10 year old boy, and also the police officer.  Background information tells a story as to who we really are as a people.

I live in Utah and they put this “sakcrete” stuff on top of our freeways as a repair and it turned into a total nightmare from hell.  The stuff  did not stick and it flaked off in chunks, as you are driving down the freeway, flipping everywhere.  It was a total mess and a huge embarrassment.  Somethings might work in a “lab” but real life is a total different story.

I bought a 2012 Accent and have complained about the milage from day one and their service department and public relations have NEVER been honest. I was lucky to get 32MPG on the highway and questioned their numbers of 40 MPG. Even when I bought the car the salesman said some people were getting 47MPG? I heard they had to be broken in and it was cold outside but never the TRUTH. This was my third and last Hyundai because of their LIES. They must be retired politicians.

I agree that it's stupid that she is being punished but hug-related injuries aren't as ridiculous as it sounds.  I have a daycare and a lot of times have to enforce a "keep your hands to yourself" policy because hugs between 3 year old girls end up more as choke holds, or aren't necessarily wanted by the one being hugged which leads to shoving.  In the age of lawsuits... what options are schools ending up with?

No Problem!!!! just get yourself a take and bake!\r\n \r\nPathetic.. seriously pathetic! How about teach your teens some morals! If you are on aid keep your legs closed if you dont approve of birth control! There should be a limit how many kids one can list on aid- if you sign up pregnant with 1 child you shouldnt be able to remain on it 10 years later 3 baby daddys and 4 more kids!

My standard tip is 25%.  If a discount is applied, I tip as full price.  A 'good deal' should not impact the server's earnings.  If the service is really bad, I'll reduce the tip to 15% and make and see or call the manager to address it.  Not tipping or bad tipping doesn't improve the service.

Every four years the Republican candidate titillates the ears of the weak minded by promising to shrink government, but you'll have to go all the way back to Tricky Dick to find a Republican that actually did it. Obama is growing government 5 times slower than Bush or Reagan did, if you are a true Financial Conservative, Obama's the obvious choice, or you can get socket in the jaw again by the GOP.

You are missing the point because unlike you I am educated in the laws of quarantining an animal due to an attack.  No quarantine is needed if there is no injury sustained from the animal.  I should have guessed you have no children and only pets.  Also if you don't like the way I voice my opinion just ignore it and move on.  To much sympathy for animals.

Really want to say how nice the police officers were in Blanding, Utah.  My boyfriend and I were traveling too fast through town, got stopped.  We pulled over immediately as we realized (too late) that we were traveling too fast through town.  Both of us have concealed weapons permits, which we disclosed immediately to the first officer who pulled us over.  Since we did have a gun in the vehicle, the first officer must have called for back-up.  In a matter of a minute a second officer (a supervisor) arrived on the scene.  I was so dismayed that I did NOT have my current proof of insurance.  I had just had major vehicle repairs made due to a breakdown in Colorado.  I believe my insurance papers were somehow removed by the men doing the repair work.  Those officers could have hauled us off to jail, I believe, but they let us continue on our way back to Michigan with just a warning.  I thought for sure that we would have been detained in Blanding but it was the exact opposite.  Those 2 officers really earned a great deal of respect from us Michiganders!  Thanks to the Great State of Utah!!

I haven't bought or consumed any of their products since Budweiser pulled its NHRA sponsorship shortly after the buyout and shot me the line that they were pulling out of ALL racing in order to focus the company in a new direction, only to shift their monies solely to NASCAR.

So, basically, cops can do whatever they want. Big effin' surprise! If they don't like you, or you don't kiss their **** or feed their tiny egos you get a ticket, or go to jail. Good thing people are starting to record them and post what they do on Youtube. Most cops don't like it very much because it holds them accountable. It's not just their word against whomever happens to get victimized by them. Don't get me wrong, I know there are some good cops out there who are doing the job for the right reason: to help people. But there are WAY too many insecure little boys wearing that uniform.

I agree with you to a point. Money isn't everything, but love doesn't pay the rent. If men aren't bringing home the bacon, they need to be helping out the woman in other ways. Child rearing, house work, budgeting, grocery shopping. A lot of women I know have to go out and work full time jobs and STILL come home and work a full time job inside the home.  \r\n  \r\nIf a man can't afford to take a woman to a restaurant, they can at least remember her birthday and pick her some flowers, plan a picnic at a local park (that's FREE).  \r\n  \r\nAs a woman, my concern is what I see as a general lack of thoughtfulness with men out there lately. They work, yes, but they come home and think their day is done. They aren't thoughtful, helpful. MOST women just want a man to have some compassion.  \r\n  \r\nMy heart would just swell if my husband would stop by our local market and buy me some $3.00 flowers or go on a walk with me. And before anyone says ANYTHING, I do plenty of nice things for him, he just seems to take it for granted. :(

Well, the first millenia wasn't long enough, huh? Ok. We can do that. But the kids are whining, I'm hungry, and worked my fingers to the bone. Bring a beer and get your a$$ in the kitchen. Laundry needs doing too. I'll be in front of the TV. And hurry it up or I'll punch you in the mouth, b1tch.

I'm glad someone is standing up for what they believe in. My mother was a victim of domestic violence from my father. He would get drunk and do extremely violent things to her, WHILE MY BROTHER AND I WERE IN THE ROOM, OR IN THE NEXT ROOM OVER. He would throw her down the stairs, slam her into our chimney, verbally and sexually assault.

How much money did Obummer's administration give failing businesses (Union businesses)... this is what comes from a Socialist agenda.  Help all when in need until those who benefit (the union's) are called upon for help... then reject need and threaten Non-union workers to keep them out of your nest.  We need a change... NOT 4 more years of failed policy.  BTW... what I've heard about the Mormon religion is that they have one of the world's best welfare and assistance programs.  Work for your welfare, help those in need (church members or not)... sounds like what our country needs.

Two more years of unhonorable political theatrics ahead in my humble prediction. Republicans need to get a clue. Now, instead of 2 years from now. Won't happen tho. The unhonorable polarization of republicans is too strong at this point. \r\n \r\nCounting Bush's 8 years of dysfunction, the last 4 wasted by republicans, 2 more to clean congress, THATS 14 "f"ing years republicans have screwed this country! 14!

So let me get this straight, You think I am ignorant because the storm hit NY and NJ knocking out the power and not where these people claiming to be qualified linemen came from? Or is it because I am skeptical of their qualifications? Wow that is intelligent, you must be really smart. With that type of logic we should also send anyone that wants to help out the military on missions without training them and just trust them when they say they are qualified. What could possibly go wrong there either. Oh yea People could be killed in that situation too.\r\n \r\nThe fact is High voltage power lines are extremely dangerous and you need to be able to trust the people you are working with or you can die. Not understanding that is ignorant. Which means "Lacking knowledge, information, or awareness in general about something or in particular" in case you had the wrong word

As Filthyswit would say... more religious silliness :) \r\n\r\nSuppose he put the same faith in the prayers that "cured" his wife's cancer, and pray that his leg grows back.We all know that will never happen. Put your faith in science and get you a bionic leg son!!! This is the exact reason science will always dominate religion, faith, and prayers. Oh, and for the record, science cured polio, not prayers... LOL  \r\n\r\nSeems to me if God cured his wife's cancer and he lost a leg, that's a fair trade. Especially when dealing with the most evil deity known to mankind

Robert you look like one serious dude.. The big question is when is the tipping point {peak high temprature} that is going to suspend enough water vapor in the air to cause the reversal and big cool down?? We pretty much know that the cool down is very fast and the warm up is very slow.. Since we swing back and forth on 200,000 to 350,000 year cycles and none of the experts can verify the min. and max temps but some agree and some disagree that we have/have not peaked yet.. This all proves nothing..

This is a slanted picture, not to mention out of date. A traditional degree may not mean as much as it used to (see below).  Women are still taking more degrees in Liberal Arts and Business than in Science.  Areas of study such as intellience analysis (both military and business), however, have seen certain courses deleted in favor of a "softer" approach that may make the degree more attractive to some women, but rob students of useful tools.  What men are doing, in contrast, is flocking to technical schools and places that have a "hands on" approach.  In more traditional colleges and universities, they still tend to dominate in engineering and other fields that involve the dreaded "math and science." Thank Goodness some girls and women understand that while women tend to be better with verbal skills than men at least early on, that doesn't mean females have to struggle with other subjects -- they just have to tackle them early in life, and not avoid them later on. (And not every person's brain is wired the same way. The days of those talking dolls that say, "Math is hard" are gone.)  Both men and women today recognize that the concept of "marrying up", however, is archaic. Using online training and eduation, both men and women can target their studies as adults to remain competitive in their chosen field, or change their field as the job market changes. Whether that study lead to a traditional degree is irrelevant.  Who earns what will depend on adaptability and willingness to keep learning. Initial, traditional levels of education may have very little to do with lifetime earnings.  Finallly, marriage is a partnership, not a contest, I should point out.

Team Romney Admits “Relief” Event Was Staged for Political Reasons \r\nI also found this part of the story fascinating. The Romney campaign admits that the intent behind the rally was swing state election visibility, not hurricane relief: \r\n \r\nBut Boston wasn’t quite ready to lose a full day of swing state visibility with a week left in the race. So, after some deliberation, the campaign decided to use their existing venue in Ohio to stage a makeshift, and nonpartisan, humanitarian project. It would be a way for Romney to show leadership — and get on the local news — without looking craven or opportunistic. \r\nThey weren’t willing to lose a day’s visibility in a swing state, so they came up with the event and crafted it in a way that would still get them political benefit, but would camouflage the intent.  So, as I predicted, Team Romney saw Hurricane Sandy – saw the imminent peril of tens of millions of Americans – as a political "oppotunity" to exploit.

The eastern coastal areas hit hard by Sandy have done nothing in many decades to prevent this kind of devastation from a huge hurricane because they are broke and because these kinds of hurricanes rarely hit that part of the US. The last time before last year with Irene was between 1954 and 1960 when the east coast was hit with 10 huge hurricanes. Those of us in Texas have been plagued for years with huge storms but each time they rebuild it is with better planning and architecture to deal with hurricanes. Maybe New York and New Jersey will rebuild smarter.

What does it have to do with Staten Island?  The connection is that the Federal government is responding (with even devout Republicans agreeing) to the whole disaster in both Jersey and NY at a response level far better than Katrina.  There just aren't radically quick fixes with such massive destruction.  In fact, Romney thinks each state can deal with disasters better without Federal manpower (I think Bush took that approach with Katrina).  The problem with that thinking is that a state can't do sh*t when its infrastructure is wiped out.  Thank God for large Federal agencies that are able to provide disaster relief at all.

"Oh, really? We lost four people in Benghazi? That's not "Optimal", but we can cover it up until after the election, when I have more flexibility" \r\n \r\nHere’s CBS’ latest release on Benghazi,       Not from Fox; \r\n When the Mainstream Media starts Outing Obama, you know The Chit is about to Hit the Fan!\r\n\r\n  "CBS News has released a clip of an interview by Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes on Sep. 12 with President Barack Obama that indicates Obama knew the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya was a premeditated terror attack–and suggests the White House later deceived the public by blaming protests against an anti-Islam video. CBS chose not to air the clip for over a month–but did air Obama’s attack on Romney that same night." \r\n  \r\n"CBS News has learned that during the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, the Obama Administration did not convene its top interagency counterterrorism resource: the Counterterrorism Security Group, (CSG)." \r\n  \r\n“The CSG is the one group that’s supposed to know what resources every agency has. They know of multiple options and have the ability to coordinate counterterrorism assets across all the agencies,” a high-ranking government official told CBS News. “They were not allowed to do their job. They were not called upon.“

I just read the book; "The Corporation; The Pathological Pursuit of Power and Profits" by Richard Bakan. This not only exactly conforms  to what he's written about, that corporations, now people because of Citizens United and a corrupted, politicized Supreme Court, are psychotic people. Economist Milton Friedman would applaud the use of slave labor because in his opinion, the corporation has one objective and that's to increase profits and it's immoral for them to consider morality in their actions, a betrayal of the shareholders. This is not just the state of the world today but throughout time; read the books of 100 years ago by the muckrakers. This is the world of Mitt Romney and the plutocrats whose railing against "big government" is a ruse to eliminate all policing of corporations and the methods they use to increase the bottom line including slave labor, cruel and inhuman employment practices, ruining the health of the young, destructionof the environment, and social responsibility of any kind except for PR purposes. If you are a working person and vote Republican, you are voting against your own human interests and those of the helpless and poverty stricken around the world. Try squaring that circle of your professed Christian beliefs. That the stockholders are filing this suit is an interesting and hopeful development. To give up some of your dividends so as to compel the corporation to do right is the most hopeful sign possible, far more so than government regulations.

But workers for Joe Wheeler, based in Trinity, Ala., are unionized and are going home after being deployed to Denton, Md., according company spokeswoman Mandi Philips.\r\n"I don't know how we got thrown into the mix," she said, adding that the crews are coming home because their work is done. "As we waited for clarification, we became aware that Seaside Heights received the assistance they needed from other sources," the statement says. "To be clear, at no time were our crews 'turned away' from the utility in Seaside Heights\r\n====================  ​ ====================  ​ ==============\r\n \r\nGOP/TP = the Party of Bullsh!t,  Posters like  jdmeck, longislandtea and TWWI1961 seem to love to wallow in it, they give meaning to the word "stupidity".  The article cleary states the work ork crew WAS unionized, but went home because other crews to care of the work.  Why don't you guys try to spin the Brazilian Oil Loan again.

I have not had a speeding ticket for years because I never drive more than five (5) m.p.h. over the limit. I do this by using my cruise control when on the open road and observing my odometer at all other times. The last ticket I remember, a state highway patrolman  charged me for 72 in a 60 m.p.h. zone on an interstate. I was polite to the officer and pled NOT GUILTY to the charge and appeared in court at which time I declared my intent to represent myself WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A COURT APPOINTED LAWYER. and requested SIX MONTHS TO STUDY THE LAWS SO I COULD DEFEND MYSELF FROM THESE FALSE CHARGES, AND THAT A LAW LIBRARY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ME.  When I returned to court at a later date, I told the judge that the lawyer was biased and would not give me the assistance I needed and asked for a different lawyer and another six months to prepare. The judge looked at me , laughed and said " I remember you." and dismissed my case.

First: there have been hundreds of disasters around the world. The South East has had 10 times the amount of storm damage than the NY area. Tornadoes have wiped out whole towns in the Mid-West.  Remember the Tsunami in Japan. Devastation: you bet.  Crying about it:  Un-American. Put down your damn cell phones; pick up a shovel, and build your life again.  Tears and complaining won't get it done.

You can take your pick of any other Dog for free ??? !!!\r\nI'd be like okay, give me back My Dog, you don't just replace a Dog as you would a fallen hamburger that hit the floor.  In most cases a Family Dog is just that !!! a Family Dog, he she's part of the Family.  To our Family that would be very close to running over one of our Kids and then saying that they are sorry but you can go down and pick out another child from the lock up to replace it, no,,, it doesn't work that easily.  There's a heavy bond between Family and their Dog that makes that Dog Family.\r\nI wouldn't take very kindly to someone doing that to us as if the Dog was just a deposible item,,,, THEY'RE NOT!  It's hard enough when the Pet gets old and has to be put down or to find it in the corner of the room dead from old age.  \r\nI hope those at the Dog Shelter gets around to reading some of these, they are in bad need of learning what a Family Dog is to a Family.

I agree with Socially Unacceptable. Almost every comment (most of them idiotic) are saying New Yorkers this, New Yorkers that. Truth is, it can happen anywhere in this country. No matter how big or small the city is. We as humans will ALWAYS be worried about ourselves as individuals. When s**t hits the fan in your hometown, you really think you're going to be worried about the next person? No, only you and your family. I mean com'on, why waste time helping out another person or family when you got your own took care for in a time of crisis? Its the survival mode kicking in. Steal and Kill. Pillage and Plunder. You hypocrites know you will do the same thing. But of course the only reason the majority of you are even commenting on this subject is because you live nowhere near New York or along the east coast and lower states where hurricanes and powerul storms are unheard of.

Breaks my heart. I miss the Country Music. I don't know why I even watched part of it. I quit listening to the radio a long time ago..Country stations started going by the wayside..There are many people out there that want the Awards to go back to Country. That other stuff has their own awards.....I won't gripe anymore..Just miss the old Reba style, George Strait and just plain old Country Music...I'm not gripeing about all the winners  ...  but it is just sad ..you don't even see some of the great country singers in the audiences anymore...they are still around ....I am old...I spent my early years listening to Hank Thompson and others jamming (as you call it) in my family's kitchen.....  I grew up listening to the great stars before they were great....it is just sad.

The most life-changing moment I've ever experienced, was watching my now 32 year old son come into the world.  Til the very moment I laid eyes on him, I hadn't wanted to be a father.  The very second I saw him, it all came together for me, and I knew, clearly, my purpose was to take care of him, and make sure he grew up to be a contributing member of society.  After high school, he joined the Marines, served dutifully in Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia (during the civil war), and now is a married father of my two beautiful grandsons.  This guy is a jerk, and a myopic, spoiled, simpering fool.

That means that the warming process is speeding up. Of course, with how thick your skull seems to be, you still won't understand. It's all a lie to you.

Did any of you read through this story? I did. I am a supervisor (non union) that oversees a union workforce. We have few problems and the problems we do have are mostly minor issues. Getting back to the story, if you read it through, you will come to see it was the union workers that were going home not the non union employees. The non union group were being sent to NY. Maybe if everyone would look at all workers as individuals and give each their own contract everyone would be happy, except for the HR people doing the yearly evaluations on a few million people.....think!
