2 to 1 he is a latent pedophile. They dont like gays because of the confusion in identity. And there is no correlation between the gays and pedophiles except they both have sexual preferences, the gays want other gays and a pedophile wants a child and only his god would know why. My God passes on that one.

Invest in your family and friends. Yeah, I know.....financial advisors advise against that...because THEY want to lend to your family and friends....and charge them HUGE interest rates-----using YOUR MONEY! Yup! The money that the banks pay you a paltry 1/2 % for the then loan out for upwards of 6,7, even EIGHTEEN PERCENT! \r\nCut out the middle man banks, and loan your kids the money to buy a car, a house, etc. Charge them less than the banks rates, yet more than what the banks will pay YOU. Loan your neighbor the money for that boat, loan your nephew the money for college and to HE// with the bank taking the lions share of everyones money. Most importantly, PLACE LEINS and GET COLLATERAL....just as the banks do. It's a win-win situation for all....and let the bankers starve and the banks collapse. They do NOTHING but take everyones money and call it theirs. It's YOUR money. Use it wisely!  DON'T get your financial advice from the banking and investment community. Their only advice is in THEIR interest...not yours.

It´s gotten to the point that you never know if you´re correctly speaking...everyday someone feels offended by what was said, written, or in this case, worn. For example, I´m mexican and I don´t feel offended by someone wearing a mariachi costume, it´s just a costume, like any other. Do Americans have to feel offended if someone dresses up as the Statue of Liberty?  \r\nCome on, relax and have some clean fun!

you say you've successfully timed the market... over a seventeen-year period? (17? !!!) \r\nThat statisically did not happen.  No professional has been able to accomplish what you say you did.  Nobody.  The best and brightest out of Wharton, Stanford, Harvard ...   None of them have done it.   And this baloney about staying in getting people in trouble?  Let's look at the last seventeen years for example.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 4755 on October 26, 1995.   Last Friday, the "DOW" closed at 13107. That represents a gain of more than 175%.   Your "in and out" approach likely did not go up 2.75 fold. If you believe you did that well, go ahead and apply for a position with Goldman Sachs, and good luck with that.

Dodgy - the term sqaw didn't become offensive until a couple of guys said it was in a 1970's book.  It comes from Massachusettes-area native languages (1600's or so) for "young woman."  I was addressing slayer's skewed views on Native American kids today.

Exactly the same thing I said in my post! Obama wants the US to turn into a dictatorship with him as our amazing and wonderful leader who gives us our food, housing, OBAMAcare,etc so we can praise the great idiot Obama while he and his ugly wife live the high life in designer clothes, gourmet food, parties with Jay Z and Beyonce, etc. Anyone that puts his own name in a healthcare reform really has some narcissim and egocentrism going on. I guess the money fairies are going to pay for that free healthcare...O wait, it will be those of us who do have jobs and work and pay our bills paying for those who are poor and less fortunate with 5 or 6 kids.

It wasn't diverted because of the "elves"; the actual term would be "land wights" - which are, essentially a form of elf. Remember that Iceland was predominently settled by Vikings, and that is part of their lore and faith. Anyone who is knowledgable about or follows the Norse tradition could tell you about it. Avoiding the boulder is no different than preserving a spot because of historical or Christian significance.

Every singer can only perform it within the limitations of their own style and talent.  Only a few have the vocal range to hit the highest notes well.  The Star-Spangled Banner was originally written as a *poem* by Francis Scott Keys.  I cannot recall who wrote the musical score to which it is played today.

It was on the news as a fake as well.  I wish there were some laws passed so that campaign ads could only spout the truth and no lies or half truths or stuff taken out of context.  There are too many ignorant people who believe some of that trash.  There should also be laws on the amounts of money for a campaign as well so our presidency is not bought and paid for by big business and we wind up with a puppet they pull the strings on--hence, Romrat.  Sorry, I see bad things if he's elected and women will pay dearly going back to the 1900's almost on taking charge of their own bodies etc.

I used to go to the casinos often.   I won a lot of money and in time I lost a lot of money.   I went to card counting classes to increase my odds of winning.  So it no longer was any fun, all business.  So I don't go to A. C. very often any more.

Um, when most people speak of a "creator" and "souls", they are referring to their god, and since you ended your post with the words "amazing grace" (another religious reference) I am certain that is the "creator" you were speaking of in your initial post.  I'm sure you left it ambiguous just so you could fire back saying "oh, I didn't mention god."  I'm not antsy.  I just find it annoying that some assume that everyone believes in some larger than life creator or supreme being.  Many of us do not.  My opinion is that there is no "creator" aside from my mother and father, so unless you are referring people setting their "souls" right with their parents, lol, not everyone is going to agree with you. Of course, I don't believe in "souls" either so I don't know why I would think it right to set my "soul" right with anyone at all.  \r\n\r\nIn terms of closure, just because YOU don't think it does any real good to know what happened doesn't mean that many close to the victim don't feel the need to know when they lose young loved ones tragically and unexpectedly.  Knowing what happened will not bring them back, but for some it may help them to move on.  I speak from experience.  Sometimes one of the worst things is not knowing the why or how.  If you never know, you may torture yourself the rest of your days wondering if there was something you could have done.  Sometimes knowing and having closure does help some move on regardless of what you believe.

Hello justme08582, the Republicans and Fox news started calling it Obama care first as a way to stigimitize the public. Looks like it backfired. Now those with Pre existing conditions and those who can keeop their kids on until 26 so they can finish College and have health care. God forbid we have that kind of caring society. Any non Multi Millionare voting for Romney is like a chicken voting for Conel Sanders of KFC.

eliminate the electoral college, it makes "one person, one vote" obsolete and btw you NEVER see prez candidates shmoozing voters in alaska or s. dakota, just the big or battleground states.......term limits, ie 12 terms in house (24 years) and 4 terms in senate (24 years).......and a rep CANNOT run for senate after congressional term is up.........eliminate  ​  lobbyists, they represent no one except themselves......no more than 10 years for a supreme court judge, that life crap doesn't cut it.......a balanced budget amendment, balance or you're outta there.....lord, a guy can dream, can't he??

The Japanese are so deep in culture, that's one thing lacking in the U.S., culture. We just grab at the newest latest fades that come along, no real in depth culture. Culture is a way of life, not just a belief. Like when you grow a garden it must be cultivated. The weeds need culled, etc. Culture is based on removing the un-necessary and maintaining the necessary. Focus, goals, ambition, refusing to accept failure, this is their culture. To cultivate, if you will. Americans are caught up in division, ie: religion, justice, politics, discrimination, crime, that's the basis of our culture or the lack there of. Maybe that's why they're leaps and bounds ahead of the U.S.........Culture.  ​

Powers.  Not to mention the fact that Porsche has proven their reliability in motorsports with over 30,000 victories, which is more than any other manufacturer on the planet.

I'm bi-sexual and A christian and GOD LOVES ME FOR WHO I AM!\r\nThis is not a preacher and a say that because the Bible book\r\nMatthew 7:1-6 says: “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. \r\n3 “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? 4 How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye. \r\n6 “Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.

i think unless you ARE part of a culture being represented wrong then it's hard to understand WHY it's offensive to those cultures. Its similar to the N words now a days in that at one point in history it was used as a general term for a certain type of minority. Not only was squa used but it does mean bad things toward native women especially.  Its rude and if people use it theyre either very old or very uneducated in that way. Also its maddening because its a HUGE Misrepresentation of Native american culture culture (of which there are MANY) \r\n\r\nI grew up near a reservation and the majority of people were native and no one even more traditional people loo anything like this and no girls braid their hair pigtails and brown clothes and the only time you wear moccasins is for ceremony and special things and they arent like the awful costume. To who ever said so what they still have the chief one thats offensive to, to a cultures higher up but its not as demeaning as the word squa for a native girl costume thought up BY white people. No way will racist gross misrepresentation costumes stop but the labels must be TRYING to be sensitive and accurate on SOME level. Its all fun until its YOUR culture paired with bad language

I can never understand people who have zero faith in humanity, especially your fellow US citizens.  Never mind that average life spans in the US are constantly going up, people's quality of life is always going up, largely due to better nutrition and work by groups such as the FDA that keeps our food safe and our drugs at least some level of legitimacy and efficacy.\r\n\r\nBottom line, Vaccinations = GOOD, FDA = GOOD, quacks on the internet telling you not to get vaccinated and that organic is better = BAD.

<exasperated sigh> You claimed that when you were in Catholic school the nuns "did stuff like that (ie. stuff like this preschool teacher did) to me all the time". You then said that "it must have worked 'cause when I see the imbecile posters online who can't spell or construct a sentence or think, I now know it was all for the good". I'm asking why you seem to think that the "stuff" the nuns did to you caused you to become so much smarter than the "morons online"? If that "stuff" hadnt happened to you do you think that you wouldn't be as smart as you are today? Do you think that dumb people might not be as dumb if that "stuff" had happened to them? All i'm asking for is a shred of evidence that that "stuff" does what you claim it does.  \r\n  \r\nSo let me rephrase my original question in the hopes that you might answer it. \r\n  \r\nWhat is the connection between having that "stuff" happen to you as a child and your intelligence in your adult life? That's your claim. THAT is what i am asking.

While morally terrible, it was marriage based on false pretenses.\r\n\r\nJudges are not there to say what is morally right, merely legally based upon the culture's laws. Those of you who allow your moral judgement to alter your perceived form of interpretation of the law illustrate just how shitty of judges you'd be. Great people yes, shitty judges though.

Too bad Dez Bryant didn't get credit for that amazing (reversed TD) catch last night.  That was definitely worth cheering for. \r\n  \r\nThat's all I have to say about that for now.

The same is often true if you reword your comment by switching "wife" for "husband", "she" for "he", etc.

WTF does this have to do with with a woman being booted off a train?? I swear you people are so fuc*ing brainwashed, you can't even distinguish between reality and your fairy tale world of political conspiracies and mindless vitriol. I'm sure the large media outlets would love to hire you as an author.

justme080582, you are so misinformed is not even funny. Tax evasion? Mitt will not release his last 2 years of tax returns because if he does we will know how much of a tax dodger he is and he will surely lose the election. This man has tax shelters in the Caymen Islands. In Swiss bank accounts pays less than 14 percent compared to 30 percent of a middle class worker and founded Bain capital a outsourcer of thousands of American jobs. He or his kids never served in the military but yet he talks aggressive about our foreign policy? Why is he behind 30 points in Massachusetts, the state where he was governor? What do they know about Mitt that we don’t? Use some facts and critical thinking skills and stop with the fox news talking points.

The purer the ethnic pool, the deeper the culture.  Multiculturalism by definition has no unique 'culture.' \r\n BTW: Multiculturalism doesn't work - no matter how hard people try and convince you.
