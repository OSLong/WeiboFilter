Too funny, but sadly, you're wrong Natasha Grace.  This election is about WOMEN's RIGHTS to: her body, to choose, insurance coverage for her birth control (men's ARE covered by insurance), equal pay, the economy (as a whole), the deficit, energy, making BIG BUSINESS, BIG PHARMA, ENERGY "accountable" for their actions and the environment, AND last but not least, "Democracy vs Plutocracy."

pit bulls are not born mean, they are taught to attack, fight, etc because of heartless people.  i have been in the company of many pit bulls who have scars, fur missing, an ear missing & they are the most beautiful, loving creatures.  they have the need & desire to please no matter what & i think it's a crime to stereotype these magnificent dogs.

With a weapon trained on them, it's much easy to have time to ID.. and people not going for a gun don't make sudden moves in that circumstance.  Besides, you're talking like they came through a door and I was just standing on the other end.  Do you think any reasonable person wouldn't secure a vantage point that would give them an advantage?\r\n\r\nIf they came in without noise and wanted me dead, I'd be dead anyway.\r\n\r\nYou act like I said "You sit them down, get them a drink and get their life story."  No, you ID them and calmly resolve the situation.  Hopefully without loss of anyone's life in the process.  When a gun is drawn, I really hope the homeowner doesn't want to pull the trigger.. but it it's drawn they need to be able to.

Nobama said it all at his last debate he is going to ban Assault Rifles and tighten down on gun purchases in general.  Two thumbs down on a Government that would take away my rights.  I agree with Romney we need to make use people don't have automatic rifles and do a better job on checking people out before they buy them.

I think you sound like a bitter moron Ozz760. How excatley is it "un-classy" to write a fun, catchy song about your ex. He clearly mocked her talents, played games with her and toyed with her. So yes, Taylor is totally un-classy from freeing herself from that situation, writiing a light-hearted song about it and moving on. You made a really good point there Ozzy.

Well as long as the kids were off breast feeding___. No seriously! I see Disney's point. Some child stalker could easily fool a child this way and kidnap or harm he or she. If she really wasn't so obvious with the neck line of the costume  it may not have brought as much attention. I mean what if Willard came to Disney with his family? It would scare the long johns off of them. lol

You think Obama is kind?  That's why we have 4 dead embassy workers.  He gives money to the Muslim Brotherhood, but not one penney to provide security for our embassy workers, who repeatedly asked for it in the months before their deaths.   These people didn't have to end up dead.   So much for your kind Obama.

Your pants is on fire buddy.  Romnesia is a more accurate term than flip flopping, when all of a sudden you're solidly against a position that you've been touting for months.  Without even saying 'I've changed my mind' or at least 'reconsidered my position' ...none of that.  Just "I've never said that".  He seriously thinks America is going to buy that and elect him president in this age of youtube.   Every lie is on record.  Obama has NEVER DONE THAT.... NEVER!

I have a '91 Coupe and I still love this body style and design more than any other Vette. It just has the smoothest of lines from front to rear.  The profile from the side is just as smooth.  I get a number of compliments on it from non-Vette owners and Vette owners alike.\r\n \r\nIt is my first and may be my only Vette, for I don't know what other one does anything for me, and only having 12 grand in it (less than the cost of a used Dodge Neon!), I made a nice purchase, and even an investment, if you will.  The on-the-fly suspension change is the rat's ****.  It is a 5.7 that is only 250 hp but it still moves off the line and is a six-speed.  Don't even think of putting it in sixth unless you are doing at least 65, and at 65, it's at 1400 and getting about 25 mph.  \r\n \r\nA nice, sporty car that doesn't kill the wallet on gas consumption, and is plenty quick and fast enough for anyone that wants to sport around, drive fast, and have a ride that is not any different than many sports cars.  \r\n \r\nAnd being white, she is stealth.  Doesn't draw attention until one sees her lines --- almost like looking at a smooth, curvy lady with with tight dress and no panties on...\r\n \r\nGood luck to the new Vette.  I can't afford it and my lady is a great looking and performing ride anyway.  Sometimes, the grass is greenest right in one's own backyard...\r\n \r\n \r\nPeace.\r\n \r\nlv\r\n \r\nIlion, NY

I am a dem., and do believe in the second amendment and this one should" piss off" most of of the bloggers on this site,"  I am a proud african american". I believe all legal law abieding citizens should be able to purchase any and all legal firearms that they desire. I  am responding to the isnoopy rant . I agree gun control isnt working in its present form and you are correct that its harder for legal gun purchases,but what is your solution? Give anyone who wants gun one? Do you even know how most illegal guns end up in quote(generic ****er drug dealer,murder,rapist,terro  ​ rist,etc) hands? Think about it and I'll inform.This is from direct experience,they are acquired from drug addicted suburbanites(caucasi  ​ ans) entering urban areas to percure whatever they'.re drug of choice. This happens on a daily basis,by the hundreds in all areas where drugs are sold.You are right, you won't stop criminals from acquiring guns, just like you can't stop racist a-holes from being racist a-holes!

Celebrity endorsements may have a huge impact. Don't forget about the power of social media. Consider Twitter. Kim Karshashian has over 13 million followers on Twitter. Oprah Winfrey has over 14 million followers. Justin Bieber has over 17 million followers. They influence the daily decisions of millions of people on things ranging from fashion to --you guessed it-- voting! Do not underestimate the power of a celebrity endorsement.

As a believer in the 2nd amendment and defending oneself and home.  So, if someone broke in, they'd never to it to anyone else.  \r\n \r\nThis case is very similar to many others, a responsible gun owner has an intruder come in and ends the threat.  "frumple" asks a very good question, without the weapon, what happens to this girl?  Same question applies to the three kids in Texas (14-year-old boy defended himself and siblings against an intruder), the older lady in Oklahoma who killed a guy trying to break in, the girl in Montana who blew an intruder down the stairs as he came up after her, and the list goes on.

MIRAGE GUY....You disgusting, right-wing,  shilling porcine piss-poor specimen of a human being.  This lady admitted to having to use support to fill the void until she could become truly productive.  She has been working and paying taxes (which resupplies what she took  before, or pays it forward) and has raised her kids even against the odds (which includes paying more taxes as a ratio compared to the Filthy Rich).  What kind of moronic criticisms  can you make against that?   This individual has worked more than you, harder than you and likely pays more taxes (in ratio) than you.  You have no right to take her to task!  She is the Worker, You are the Leech, in this equation...get it? \r\n\r\nGood...now get out. Take your imaginary factory to Mexico. And be grateful I am in  a kind mood today. \r\n\r\nMclass Nobody- Bravo for you.  I am sure your girls acquired more than the lust for money that other poster displayed just now.  They should be proud of their mom.\r\nAt least you didnt sell them into White Slavery like that sickening ratchet mouth MG would have. \r\n\r\nChin up, Keep the Faith and Carry on, miss.

Pit Bulls can be very loving, gentle, great pets. Or they can be very dangerous destructive killers. It all depends on the breeding, conditioning, and care they recieve. If you breed aggressive bad **** dogs to fight other pits, thats what you have. Owners and breeders make these animals crazy with the conditioning to prepare them to fight. If you raise a good full breed pitbull from a pup in a family environment. You won't find a better dog anywhere. It all depends on what is done with these animals. People that torture and condition these dogs to fight are to blame for the bad rap they have. And should be shot in my opinion.

My 82-year old MIL has terrible money management skills that have no chance of improving.  My husband and I only pay for things such as medicine, doctors, etc, as needed. She is so resentful that she can't keep up with the more affluent retired people in her church group. We never made their incomes, so that's not our problem if she can't keep up with the Jones. When there is a bona fide need, we have her put the pharmacy, doctor, or medical supply company on the phone and then pay wiith our credit card. Is she grateful? Nol She whines-"You make me look so bad-can't you just give me cash or add me to your credit card?" No way-no how! \r\n  \r\nI am so happy we all don't live in the same city-she begs her church friends for money!

Jose, a legal citizen in the U S has a household income of 50,000. He pays a total of $14,000 in taxes,$350/mo for health care, with two children he spends $7200/yr on food and incedentals, That leaves him about $24,000 for housing, transportation, utilities and other household expenses.\r\n \r\nJorge, an illegal working in the U. S. has household income of $50,000, receives payment as a contract worker, pays no federal  state or local income taxes, no SS, no unemployment insurance charges, only about $1500-1800 in sales taxes, buys no health insurance just goes to free clinics or emergerncy rooms, he owns no taxable property so pays no property taxes although his children are in public schools and qualifies for food stamps through low declarations of wages which cant be tracked.\r\nAt the end of the year, he has approx $42,000 for household expenses vs Joses $24,000. why would he apply for citizenship. Of that $42,000, a significant amount is sent back to his country of origin.\r\nOne example among many where the middle class hard earned money is directed to support and solicit like ethnic and social groups votes. I dont know why any legal resident or foreigner would buy into this national disgrace regardless of political party.

Somebody we know, (lives in the bronx) takes all of this too seriously. I just dont want to be messed with. After getting my account banned, I hooked up with someone from MSN.now and that person, if the are cloning my account or harrasing me...Gone, less that ten min.You can tell me from any fakes, I am always respectful to you guys.

It is completely unfair, and quite frankly, stupid and small minded to say that pit bulls are inherently dangerous. It is an unfair stereotype. ALL DOGS ARE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS, even a Chihuahua! The problem is the owners - the care, the training they do or don't provide, and the people who stand by and watch them treat animals badly. What is really disgusting is that we see & hear about animal hoarders all the time - how they raid them, clean up the place, AND THEN BAN THEM from ever owning another pet...and then we see people like Mike Vick being allowed to own another dog? He shouldn't be allowed to own a flea, never mind a dog! Oh, but I forgot - he's a great football player! SMH

Who cares what celebrity supports whom!  I mean common, are people realy dumb enough to vote for someone just because a celebrity they like endorses him?  That's pretty shallow and I would hope that people will at least do research on a candidate and vote for the person they truly believe will lead our country best over the next 4 years. I understand we all have our individual beliefs and most of us are either democrats or republicans, but we should really vote for those issues that are most important to us and the future of our country and not just because of one issue we like or simply because a celebrity endorses them.

My sleeping position says I'm sleeping.  When I'm not, I'm tossing and turning, trying to get back to sleep or get to sleep in the first place.  I'm married and sleep with my husband, so it also says I'm trying to fit in the bed and stay in it (he's tall).  He's also a "cling-on" so I'm teetering on the edge of the bed trying to get him to stay away so I can sleep (he won't leave me alone).\r\n \r\nThis article is really stupid.  I wonder if Obama's government threw money to fund this Phipps' study so he could become an "expert"?  Or did Bush?  Either way, stupid.

Smart parenting. Black mobs have taken over the cities in this country. Violent crime is up 20 percent just in the past year. They are raping, killing and maiming Whites all over the country. It's big fun.  i shoot and have my gun with me at all times. Every parent should teach their children everything about guns. They should have to take gun safety classes every year in childhood, and learn how to shoot accurately. This is a violent world, and its only going to get worse, thanks to the race baiters like Sharpton, Jackson, Jealous, NAACP that encourages Black Hate against Whites. Then you have the druggies that will do anything for the drugs they want. So wake up people. these people will kill you and your family. Be prepared, and prepare your family to deal with it.

For a wax treatment, you might want to try Collinite Pre-was and then an application of Collinite paste wax.  It's made in Utica, New York, close to where I live.  It started out as a marine wax for boats and has carried those properties over to their carcare line.  It is hands-down one of the best product lines out there, if not the best.\r\n \r\nRead the review on it and try it yourself.  You will be hard-pressed to find it outside this area because they are realtively small but you can get it through an internet site rather than a brick and mortar store.\r\n \r\nYou WILL be impressed.

Beth do you know what you're talking about? An AK47 is a semi automatic rifle and nothing more. Have you ever seen how much damage a SHOT GUN can do? Especially with the barrel sawed off with a simple hack saw? Besides there aren't any AK's left...Obama and Holder sent them all (untracked) to Mexico resulting in deaths of hundreds including an agent named Brian Terry.

It is perfectly fair to ask pointed, sometimes difficult questions of those who seek public office. It would be refreshing if morons, such as those on The View, would ask the same caliber questions of those on the Left as they ask those on the Right. But, sadly, as Liberals do not subscribe to balanced tactics, truth or equal respect... it ain't gonna happen when they are the ones doing the asking. \r\n\r\nBy the way, Coastie... where do you intend to spend eternity?

Let's get over the white guilt.  Vote for the person who will be best for the economy.   We can't afford 4 more years of the same.  If you think there are are a lot of vacant deserted stores now,  another 4 years of the same and it will be much worse.  Think about the kind of country you are leaving your children.

L.H.606 (Luke), thank you for your response.  Sure, I would love to talk to you about my "incessant" postings about Fisher Investments.  The only reason that I continue to post these WARNINGS about Fisher Investments is because they are absolutely the truth, and if I can prevent just one person from being screwed by this charlatan (Ken Fisher) than my time and efforts are well worth it.  I certainly wish that someone would have had the "guts" to post the truth about Fisher Investments back in 2008; if so, I would now be better off by about $130,000!  Incidentally, "Luke" you failed to tell me how I might contact you.   Don Moore P.S.  I'll be writing to you again, soon.

Ask the Lord for forgiveness for breaking one of his 10 commandments! "Thou shall not kill" because it is in conflict with that thing about "honor thou mother and thou father" DAD TAUGHT ME TO ALWAYS SHOOT THE S.O.B. Like he always said,"If they are stupid or crazy enough to break in on you, they are stupid enough or just crazy enough to kill you" The military taught us to shoot to kill, but what they cannot do, is to teach everyone how to deal with it later in life. You have to do what you have to do for protection. I pray that the child gets some guidance and support.

Hey Greg Teta -- following along with the not-very-thrilling Rolling Stones ticket news: \r\n \r\n sold out their Nov. 25 and 29 shows at London's O2 Arena in just seven minutes,. Fans apparently snapped up the arena's least expensive seats, priced around $152, in just three minutes, while the priciest seats at around $601 were gone a few minutes later.\r\nThe high traffic caused Ticketmaster to crash before the tickets had sold out. A holding page read, "We're experiencing high demand. You will be automatically directed to the page requested as soon as it becomes available. Thank you for your patience." Resale websites are already listing tickets for as much as $20,050.

This is a happy ending for what could have been a tragedy.  And I'm in agreement with all those of you with a gun at home, that loaded and ready for your intruder.  I don't even have a problem with the guy who wrote he won't be shooting to wound.   All that said, this has nothing to do with limiting automatic weapons .  We need to make sure that only police and military are prepared for warfare with that kind of fire power.

Kids can learn how to use guns well.  If you're raised with them, or at least learn a healthy respect for them, you can use them responsibly.  That just means keeping skills sharp and being disciplined with them.\r\n\r\nBut it's unfortunately true that many who have guns don't follow that basic lesson.  Thinking it's better to have a gun and never say what it is and hope kids never find it.  That's just irresponsible.

I have always said, and I mean it sincerely, if someone breaks in, whatever gets past my German Shepherd will not make it past my 9mm.  My father taught me to shoot when I was a young girl and I taught my kids as well.  Most of my family hunts, although I prefer target shooting.  \r\n\r\nOh, and frumple, I'm likely what you would refer to as a "lib."  Your stereotyping does not behoove you.

When people bring up gun control and the Second Amendment they need to keep in mind that it consists of two stand-alone phrases. The SCOUTUS understood this. Also consider that the Bill of Rights (first 10 Amendments to the Constitution) CANNOT be abridged. Check your dictionary, abridged means "not to be shortened." They CANNOT be overturned. They CANNOT be revoked. They CANNOT be repealed. They CANNOT be CHANGED! If the 2nd amendment CANNOT be modified in any way, that means whatever the founding fathers meant, (which has finally been clarified by the SCOTUS), MUST stand until the United States no longer exists. And the only way for that to happen is through subversion or conquest.\r\n \r\nStumbled across this a few years ago. Maybe it can help people get some understanding as to why the above holds true. \r\nstrategypageDOTcomSL  ​ ASHhtmwSLASHhtmurphS  ​ LASH20080108DOTaspx\r\n \r\nBTW - Benjamin Franklin went to France during the Revolutionary War to secure state-of-the-art weapons for both the military AND militia members. They ALL got to keep them when the war was over. The militia consists of the citizenry at large, which is evident by the Constitutions of each of the several States of the Union.

She also knows that if she gets into the cabinet without permission or an emergency, she will not have any "personas freedoms" for a while. That said, DCF has come into our house and everything is still status quo. KUDOS young lady.

Each American must make up his/her own mind who to support, but the celebrities reveal a lot about themselves due to who they would support, and we should listen. The majority supports the Democratic and Progressive causes because they are based on equality, not based on a future in servitude to the rich!\r\n \r\nThose that seem to support Romney seem to have personal issues or feel that America has failed them and would wipe the slate clean and elect anybody different, without the willingness or capacity to explaining coherently why. Lindsay Lohan is a perfect example of a fallen princess, who desires change, as if a new President will make us forget her past.\r\n \r\nMaybe the majority is correct, after all.....

it is funny that you mention that Ted Nugent embarrassed Mitt, and yet you did not mention the eva longmoron didn't embarrass herself and obama by calling everyone who is not for obama your welfare momma an idiot,  eva has proved herself to be an idiot so she has the right guy , give it 3 weeks and she can move out of the states and back to mexico and take all the illegal's with her, she has had sex with most of them anyway or at least that is what Tony Parker is saying and I would believe him over a high paid hooker any day. \r\n  \r\nPAID FOR BY THE RE-ELECT AN IDIOT CAMPAIGN with donations from dumbocrats EBT cards that surprisingly still had a little money left on them even after the strip club, booze, fraud and casino expenses.

Amen, frumple.  if someone broke into my home, my dogs are there for protection but as backup- I've got my gun and am not afraid to use it.  I agree with frumple, too bad this p.o.s. didn't get to meet his (her)  maker-they are a complete waste of human flesh and deserve any agony they receive as the consequences of their actions.  Hum, consequences----do people even get those anymore, or has the bleeding heart liberals f**ked that up for us now?

What's wrong, can't handle inconvenient truth? Giving a contract to a company that trades on the South Korean stock exchange all of the sudden doesn't matter? American companies shouldn't get a contract provided by the CITY of San Antonio?

@ Jana  "Magnum"  is a St.Bernard/something mix. He can stand on his hind legs and put his front paws on my shoulders.(I'm 6'2")  And has literally taken me off my feet while playing. His knick-name is The big oaf.  :)

Idiot! From one who lived through the Cuban takeover I can tell you that comparing Obama to Castro is like comparing Kennedy to Hitler. The 'other' candidate, actually, is a lot like Castro. Like Castro, Romney is a demagogue in that he will say ANYTHING to sway the public. It doesn't matter if he says one thing here and something else there, for another public. The man is a a psychopathic liar. That's the only ay he can keep a straight face when he lies. He must think we are ALL stupid, but obviously, only some of us are.\r\n \r\nAnd as for you, FACEINTHECROWD, Cubans have BUILT Miami and a lot of Florida, not to mention many other parts of the country. No other immigrant group in the United States history has been so well assimilated or been as immediately educated and productive. You are an ****. And it is obvious that Cubans there in Miami have displaced your lazy, deluded, self-deserving life. Go flush yourself down the toilet.

I get tired of people always accusing "liberals" of being anti-gun sissies.  I am a liberal, I support the President of the US, and will vote for him next month.  I also have a 870 Wingmaster, a .357 Mag. Ruger double action revolver and a .32 Beretta semi.  Break into this liberal's house, and I will blow your redneck, teabaggin' **** out into the street!!!

I saw that plane on the runway in SF a couple years ago.  It has "Pillowbiter Express" printed on the tail section.\r\nVery appropriate!

After WWII Emperor Hirohito was asked why he did not order his troops to attack the American mainland.  His answer?  "Because every American is armed and my troops would have been slaughtered." Learn this lesson well.  NEVER give up your right to keep and bear arms.  Now the threat is not from outside armies, it's the government, the UN sucking leeches, criminals, and islamic terrorists.

Right... Because when a lady gets her egg starting to grow in her fallopian tube (a VERY life-threatening occurrance!) there's a way to save it AND the mother. What? There isn't? Wow.

Thank god she was brave enough to grab the gun and hide in the closet and shoot the bastard to bad she didn't kill him and save the tax payers a lot of money, it was either shoot him or he probably would of killed this poor girl,  I would of done the same thing except I would of made sure he was dead we have no choice but to defend ourselves now a days by any means possible, the criminal will always have a weapon on him when they want to commit a crime so we have no choice but to have a weapon in the house to protect ourselves if someone breaks in our home and tries to kill us do you think we have a better chance with or without a gun in our homes I think this little girl lived because she used the gun, right or wrong its the way of life now kill or be killed.

My Pitbull is sweet and a goofball. It IS the media who demonize her and other dogs in the Bully breed family as being awful dogs. Yes there are Pitbulls who have hurt people. But there are also other dogs who have done the same!!!! It is NOT the breed it is the owner and the care that teaches dogs to be DEMONS!!!!!!!
