Give it up Sarah.\r\nYou've been relegated to has-been status, and it shows...\r\nGive me a good laugh next week, and announce that you're considering a run for president in 2016.\r\nBetter yet, just go out and get a real f**king job...\r\n...And whoring around doesn't count.

Whatever are all you haters going to do if your candidate loses? How are you going to handle it? If any of you spewing this hate are senators or congress-persons then I see the next 4-years being even more dysfunctional then the previous. Do you all feel so helpless that all you have left is hate?

That's an interesting point, but I think they probably just didn't know for sure if any particular group was responsible.  There was another group that had been trying to drum up riots, as well - and there have been riots in the M.E. and Asia regarding the films.

1 in 10 men are gay according to the Kinsey report,  Who cares, he is still a father and a human being and the so called "Christians" and I put that in quotes, should learn the parts of the Bible about Christian love and forgiveness.  Nowhere in the Bible did Christ himself condemn or even mention homosexuality.  A lot of the so called "Christians" use verses in the old testimate to condemn homosexuality.  But neglect to read further where it also says you commit a sin when you wear plaids and checks together.  Christ did say "He who is without sin cast the first stone".  That should stop anyone from throwing one.

Sounds like Romney has something to hide along with avoiding taxes.

The reason prices are down is due to the lower cost for winter blend gasoline which are cheaper to produce than the summer blends. You can try to prop up this administration as much as you want, the people are not stupid.Wake me up when the price approaches $ 1.89.. like way back when George Bush was our president.

According to the Urban Dictionary: \r\n  \r\nshuck and jive: \r\n  \r\n      To shuck and jive" originally referred to the intentionally misleading words and actions that African-Americans would employ in order to deceive racist Euro-Americans in power, both during the period of slavery and afterwards. The expression was documented as being in wide usage in the 1920s, but may have originated much earlier.\r\n\r\n"Shucking and jiving" was a tactic of both survival and resistance. A slave, for instance, could say eagerly, "Oh, yes, Master," and have no real intention to obey. Or an African-American man could pretend to be working hard at a task he was ordered to do, but might put up this pretense only when under observation. Both would be instances of "doin' the old shuck 'n jive."\r\n\r\nIt has been adopted into non-Afroamerican speech, with a reference to behavior adopted in order to avoid criticism.     But i still think Palin came off as a racist idiot.

He was released in an area with many other squirrels around. I hope they welcomed him. He did not grow up with other squirrels. I did the best I could to socialize him. I would line the fence outside my bedroom window with peanuts to attract squirrels and they would see each other through the screen of the window. He left when he was ready. I spent many hours with him outside in my fenced in yard. He explored local trees and would come back to me when he wanted. He learned how to build a nest when he was very small.

Why is it that when anyone says anything even remotely questioning to, or about Obama they are met with a hateful force, the likes of which I have never seen before?  Don't you liberal folks have any sense of human decency in you anywhere?  Personally, I believe Obama is a muslim and was never legal to be president in the first place...  Further, he has proven himself, on every occasion he's been offered, to be a socialist dictator who doesn't really have any kindness for the American people whats so freaking ever.  The constitution sais WE the people...  Obama sais ME the people.  Romney has been nothing but a gentleman to Obama, even in the face of all Obamas hate.  I don't want to see anyone even remotely hateful running anything in our government!  As for the Donald, he is just another human being with the same rights you and I enjoy, so lay off.

This is a forum to express our views on here and those of you that think you know what the government controls and does not you are badly mistaken. I actually work for the government and everything can be control even in the Great USA. Those of you that can not stand any negative views of Obama should open your eyes, he is not perfect. But his Romney is worse, so I choose Obama also. But he has made a huge mess here himself so why are so many comments about Bush on here? This campaign has been nothing but a smear one on both sides.

Let the dead rest in peace. There are many talented people in the world. MJ was who he was. He, like all humans was not perfect. Neither was Elvis. You can spew out all the hatred OF the hatred you want to, but Micheal Jackson was the greatest entertainer in the industry. He had the respect of people like Fred Astair and Liz Taylor. Leave him alone, and Elvis too. Elvis made a big dent in the industry, but making a comparison is so stupid. MIcheal was the first Artist to create video stories to match his songs. Everyone else is a copy cat. There is no singer dancer like MJ. Some of you are jealous, the truth is, what it is. Get over it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ​ !!

Forget about BING. Let's stick to the subject and title this BIGGEST IDIOTS. After all that is going on in the world, people that can be fed, homes that can be built, jobs that can be given, these selfish dorks spend on things that have no matter. Solid gold leggings? Seriously? $23,000 freakin dollars for damn heair extensions? There are hair dressers who have worked so hard to get to a level of expertise that would charge, probably $1,000 a week. It's crazy that when you have you seem to care less about the world around you. It's those with the least that seem more humble and care more about others and the environment. People with the money to throw away like these, only give to charities and organizations  because they have to. Tax purposes, etc. I'm not saying that there are not celebraties with HUGE hearts who are conscience of our world and their fellow brothers and sisters, but it sickens me to see such idiots throw money away out of being so spoiled. Madonna, PLEASE, that dang water ain't doing a thing for you, girl. Spiritual my ****. You're as much of a stuck up Diva as you've always been. Beyonce, you ain't too far behind, woman. And J-lo, yeah, I don't even need to say a thing with your $5,000 eyebrow specialist and fox fur eyelashes. Good Lord. Remember where you came from and how you were able to manage without so much. Money does make life easier, but we must still remember where we came from and how at any time, it can all be gone.
