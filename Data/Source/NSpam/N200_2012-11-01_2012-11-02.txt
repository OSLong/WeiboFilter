If you are really Original Rude Boys and are against violence involving women, then it is about time you face the storm and stop running away from the real deal. Now is your chance to stand to Chris Brown and others out there , and make your statement, you are not supporting his action , but every man deserves a fair chance of learning in life. Do you know what your other band mates do? hmmmmm....

Yes!  The children's safety comes first and after Cedar Rapids 2008 500 year flood receded, no one but authorized personnel needed to go there.   The alternative might be to locate a large available hall where people could decorate it and the kids could go, but not tonight.  Children need to have some fun in their lives no matter what.

ANY kid in ANY high school can get marijuana from the plentiful black market.  Getting alcohol in high school is FAR more difficult, because it is legal, and regulated.  Not everybody knows someone with a 3-6 year older sibling that is willing to buy alcohol for the younger sibling.

Never before have the stakes been higher for our families and for the world. Our precious freedoms must not be taken away by this Marxist-Socialist Administration that we have today.

I think he's right. Obama has demonstrated anything but Christian values so anyone who considers themselves a Christian has no busy voting for Obama. Period. He's a self professed Muslim and Muslims feel that all Christians are Infidels so do the math. It's about time some of the Christian leaders in this country start verbalizing what many have felt for some time.

I like this show and the first season had its ups and downs solely on the fact that Whitney had a sickness in her family so they scratched the idea to make it about her and feature more story lines about her 'friends' so Whitney can travel back and forth . This season is supposed to be less about her friends (since they fired at least three actors) and more about her and her boyfriend. So let's see first before judging.

Well, I can honestly say I witnessed something very low today. I was at a local nursing home visiting a family friend and the local get out the vote people were there. They actually had the people from the Dementia ward come to the cafeteria for their turn. I was disturbed and so was a woman whos' mother had dementia and was her power of attorney. She told the vote robber in the cafeteria she did not think her mother was able to vote mentally. She asked her mother who the President of the USA was and she could not answer. The vote vampire told the daughter to leave the cafeteria or she would have her removed. The whole episode was completely appalling. Is this how absentee ballots are handled across the country for incompetent people?

Since I have been a victim of domestic violence (my first husband) I think I'm in a position to offer some insight on Chris Brown and what happened.  Yes, he did batter Rihanna, but that doesn't mean he should be punished for the rest of his life.  I got over what my husband did to me and in time we were able to be friendly when we were around each other. ( We share a daughter.)  I think Chris has been punished enough  and everyone should just DROP IT!!  If he does it again, that's a different story but for now, stop!!

I usually support PETA in their quest for animals.  An animal (dog) will give his life for you without hesitation.  Will your so called "freinds?"  But, this is a little out of the ordinary.  I would think a sign would be warranted only after a sign was erected for every person who has lost their life on the roadways.  Accidents happen. I wish they could be prevented but as of now, they haven't.  I wish PETA would do topless protests asking everyone to VOTE AGAINST EVERY INCUMBENT IN AMERICA. Congress will tell lies for 256,000 (salary and benefits) yearly. Put them in the unemployment lines!!!

I've been a conservative my entire life. I'm also a thinking person who can smell BS from all sides. Huckabee should be ashamed of supporting Fox news, if indeed he is a Christian, with all the utter hatred and lies that come from there everyday. I have found that if you view all news, and not just U.S. news,  you have a much better outlook. And you'll be much closer to the truth. Christians don't have a horse in this race they can be excited about, but please...don't let that stop you from voting.

Personal beliefs aside, I stand by what the Holy Bible says on the issues about abortion and same sex relationships.  Life begins at conception and killing an unborn child is murder, God said send the murders to Me I will deal with them.  The unnatural use of one's body is condemned by God whether it be man with man or woman with woman.  I will not support a candidate who is for funding abortion and okays same sex marriage. A vote for Romney is a vote for Godly principles, what can one say on judgment day who supported these ungodly acts?

NO! This is not so bad.  America is insured.  Earthquakes, disasters and munitions cause devastation across the globe that is much worse.  Maybe we should rethink the greed in our economic formula and our criticism of global warming scientists.  At least there was no loss of life.  The rest of the disaster can recovered from.  Time to be an American and do a house raising or two for your neighbors.

Oh give me break!  Adversity?  It is easy to deal with adversity when you have plenty of money. Britney seems like a nice person but Downey Jr. and Baldwin have turned into complete **** hats. With the devastation that Sandy caused to millions of ordinary people, MSN ran a story about how Alec Baldwn's wife had to move her red carpet dresses because her closet had a leak in it.  Oh my God!!!!  Shock Horror!!!  hey also wrote I quote "she BRAVELY stepped out onto the balcony."  Alec was pretentiously watching a movie that was about a blackout.  Oh Alec, you are so clever and perceptive, then the idiot got back to his tweeting.  I thought he was over with that.  So STFU about celebrities, they wouldn't know adversity if it kicked them in their stupid asses.

Greg Teta, I commented in general on the Townshend review at the end of the Odds and Ends thread (and posted a thumbs up for Carole King's demo version of "Another Pleasant Valley Sunday" and quoted Deer Tick). By then the thread had been overtaken by a surprise Saturday entry re Saint Etienne, and I didn't realize that everyone had stopped posting on the old thread and started on a new one. I guess I assumed you were all out buying batteries. \r\n I too was at the Wussy show in DC last night, and agree with Marty L.'s review. A couple things re the guitars - it wasn't a good mix and the amp was losing it, but I think they wanted the guitars wailing out in front anyway. For one they had a first time bass player out there, and might have felt they had to compensate by bringing the guitars out even more. Another possibilty: as Lisa said from the stage, it's risky enough to travel in a van on a normal day, but coming through the storm they were just glad to be alive. That seems reason enough to turn up the volume and let the feedback go where it may.

I gave both of my boys American Express cards when they went to college.  Neither boy abused the cards and both learned that the account had to be paid.  I liked the AmEx card because the card requires payment each month. They learned that what is charged must be paid for.  My youngest, accounting/finance/e  ​ conomics major resented the idea of paying interest and used his cash instead of the card. \r\n  \r\nSo I think that giving them cards while in college was a good experience and it also gave them a source of emergency resources if they were needed.

The college records that Trump wants the world to see won't be found under the name Barack Obama, they are under Barry Soetoro, an Indonesian foreign aid student. All major corps require college transcripts of prospective employees, why not the office of presidency? Obama could clear this up immediately and give $5,000,000 to the Sandy victims. He won't or would be exposed.

The day this country shuts God out of its decisions, is the day this country will fall.  I agree with Mike Huckabee.  We have to stand up for whats right in Gods eyes and what he wants, not just what we want,  God is in charge, not man, government or anyone else.

what's wrong with Congress is the same virus that makes Romney and Ryan very sick, they are both REPUBLICANS. \r\n     \r\n    The big news today Oct 13, 2012, is that another Company in Illinois making sensors (SENSATA), for automobiles was closed a week ago, all personnel terminated ( FIRED), with no job because the Company presently owned by Bain Corporation decided to make a larger profit by outsourcing the Company! All equipment and assembly of sensors work is now quickly outsourced to China! This is the sickness that has been killing us, our economy, and our working force for the last fourteen years , as you know it all began with Bush, Mitt Romney and the Bain Corporation, and many other Large Corporations in the USA. We better stop outsourcing our work to other countries now or we will die as a powerful country! I can't believe we still have the courage to blame Obama for the problems of lack of jobs in our USA for the last four years. Just give the citizens a brake, and stop making more lies of why the economy does not make good progress, to include the perversity of Congress a snake nest of Tea Party, and Republican members opposing every Jobs Bills that Obama proposes.  You need to know that from 2000 to 2008,the Bush years, 8.3 million service, and assembly jobs have been outsource to China, India, and Mexico! Mitt, you are a lost cause; you change your mind every time you get out of bed. You are very dangerous to the American people because we do not know for sure what you are going to do if accidentally you become president, with your liar side kick Ryan, you will take many position dealing in foreign policy, and will prove to be a killer for us, like Iraq and Afghanistan nightmare. Citizens wake up, vote for Obama president on November 6, 2012 or earlier!

Excuse me, Any New Yorkers!!!! I have a traveling companion that lives on E 141st St Bronx, NY, Do you know if that area of the city is OK?
