In 1990, facing financial collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new CEO in January 1991, he drew a symbolic salary of one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan, real-estate deals, and bank loans, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company through a turnaround and returned the firm to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.

Even if we do have another 4 years of the same, I would rather have that than to scratch the last four and go back to the previous 8 years which is what Romney is selling. Pres. Clinton said it best: "Republicans are basically saying: Obama couldn't fix the mess we left him, so give it back to us so we can continue messing it up!" MALARKEY!

The people in the wrong were those that arranged this debate.  Obama and Michelle attended Candy's wedding earlier.  Why would you give this obviously biased person an active role in the presidential elections unless those that arrange the debates are also biased?  Candy is now the Benedict Arnold of American politics as she was involved in a democrate leaning demostration that was portrayed as unbiased and influenced 64 million viewers by her obvious exaggeration of the facts.  Sorry, a generic reference to terror is not the lable of terrorist act.

A) there was no genocide of the American Indians, that's all a Marxist myth that somehow became mainstream in America......look up all the historical massacres of Indians by whites, (not counting massacres of whites by Indians), and you'll get to less than 5,000 ever murdered in cold blood.  Wounded Knee, Sand Creek...and very few others.  Wounded Knee is debatable as to who caused it, Sand Creek was a crime, but contrary to later mythology, it was actually investigated as a crime by the US Congress at the time.    The Holocaust was a genocide.  Nothing similar happened in America.  Not even to the most warlike tribes, who are all still around, Sioux, Apache, Comanche, and not even the most warlike leaders like Geronimo......got to live out all his days.\r\n\r\nB) Manifest Destiny doesn't mean anything bad......actually it referred to the pioneering effort out on the West and what seemed like our destiny to live in a great country and build a wonderful nation, which we did.

my great grandpaps were all naturalized american citizens with limited english. \r\n one generation later, my grandpap fought the nazis behind enemy lines because he was also fluent in all the eastern european languages, thanks to his parents. he earned a bronze star and purple heart and saved an entire battalion. if he didn't have to speak the old country languages, he couldn't have done any of that. \r\n in the next generation, my uncles and dad served their country in the Vietnam era.  \r\n one generation later, i became a college history professor.  \r\n my great grandpaps may have known Russian or Italian a lot better than english, but they helped make this a great nation, and their families have done things most americans haven't. what have you done for america today?

No money to educate our children! WAKE UP!!! With all that revenue on a (DAILY BASIS) there isn't NO WAY education could be broke! & the reason why it IS BROKE is because > POLITICIANS STEAL FROM THESE UNTOUCHABLE FUNDS! the same way they STEAL FROM SOCIAL SECURITY!  Thats the TRUE REASON why it's going BROKE!

Obama is just as much an American as any other citizen of this country and for you to say otherwise is to spit on the names of the countless other immigrants that have come here and formed the foundation of this wonderfully diverse nation. Furthermore, even though he may not be the greatest president in your eyes, he IS the leader and face of this fantastic country and senselessly insulting him in this way is like degrading the name of our entire nation. It is okay for you to criticize him, but you definitely should not make blatantly false comments about our president, whether that be Obama or Romney in 2013.

@Joseph, the 300 million was for the state departments budget as a whole.  It wasn't specified for security projects.  The other item brought up during the VP debate was the question why weren't the Marines there from the start?  The USMC provides embassy security throughout the world.  The cost for that security is not tied to the DOS.  The funding in question would have been used for private security, which is a another can of worms.  If you look at Afghanistan we are losing Soldiers due to this administration wanting to stay on a timeline.  The number of "friendly" fire incidents where Afghanistan security forces are killing US troops are on the rise.  US Soldiers have to rely on the locals to provide security for high level meetings putting their lives on the line needlessly.  Less than 1/3 of 1 percent of Americans choose to serve, we shouldnt throw their lives away for politics.

lets see, ever since Obama took office my healthcare coverage has tripled, gas has tripled a gallon of milk went up 3 bucks, and Obama gave out all them bailouts to so called green companies that are going bankrupt as we sit here and complain, and lets not forget the bank bailouts and the car company bailouts! The only reson these guys are trying to get in that office is to help out someone they know (friends/family). But where is our relief the real MIDDLE class (40,00to 90,000), those of us that get out there and bust our butts off 6 days a week. I see the free cell phone line every day, hell there was a lady on the news the other day that had 9 of them, and all that free help they get, I am half tempted to quit my job and go on welfare so they can pay rent and my gas and electric!!! But no I can not do that I was raised to work for what I want and if I can't afford it, I don't get!!!!!!!!!!!!! So go ahead and vote for either on of these guys, mark my word this country is going to fall HARD, our military, goverment and state are way to big for us middle class to pay for and why are we going into counties for a war that is not ours, protect our borders and waters, bring jobs back home, hell they just shut down bethsteel in Baltimore, for what to buy Chinese and japanese steel that both Obama and Rommney probrably have there dirty fingers in? Where is the person to represent us, THE REAL WORING CLASS and one more thing if you are a imagrent and not paying taxes  GO HOME TO YOUR COUNTRY we can't afford you any more

Hey Tarpaper great ideaof checking whitehouse.gov to bad to didn't, see clip below or go search for yourself "rose garden libya" will bring it up.  The use of of the word terror (not terrorism) was used referring back to the 9/11 attacks but has nothing to do with Libya. He only refers to actions as an attack. He did send more security after the attack but he still avoids answering why he turned down the request to send force before hand. The President is a grade A lier and Democrats and the media have no problem backing him up with more lies.\r\n \r\nOf course, yesterday was already a painful day for our nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 attacks. We mourned with the families who were lost on that day. I visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of Arlington Cemetery, and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed. And then last night, we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi. \r\n \r\nAs Americans, let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases, lay down their lives for it. Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe.\r\n \r\nNo acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.

"We have no freedom of speech" so I guess you should try speaking with your mouth empty. Smoking in a condo is putting your neighbors at risk for fire. The greatest danger in a fire is smoke inhalation , gases released in fire,  which can travel far from the actual fire through the roof craw spaces and walls. Killing your neighbors. People react to problems by adding restrictions to reduce the demands on public services so your taxes can be more wisely used. I suggest you want greater freedom get away from people, the greater the number the fewer freedoms you will enjoy. Hey move to Idaho.

$250,000 a year in the rural Midwest is a lot different then $250,000 in most major metropolitan areas. States like NY & CA have high state tax raates which increases the cost of amny things including gasoline which have multiple layers of taxation.  \r\n  \r\nOne daughter works in downtown San Diego. Makes about $12.50 an hour. Parking costs $12 a day. $1,800 a month for a quasi ghetto 2 - bed apartment. It is a static number, whatever number you choose does not reflect the actual cost of liviing from one place to the next. \r\n  \r\nRising tide lifts all boats, including government treasuries. Receding tides coupled with increase taxes on anyone drains the swamp. \r\n  \r\nWhen times get tough at your home, don't you cut expenses? Government is 'promoting' non-citizens to enroll in food stamp program. Increase from roughly 800,000 in 2008 to 1.63 million in 2012. Can we afford this? \r\n  \r\nNiece buys cigarrets beer and complains because she cannot afford to color in her newest tatoo with color. She's collecting welfare. Can we afford this?

That teacher should lose her job.  Forcing a child, no matter what the situation, to eat something they do not want to eat, and especially taking it out of the garbage and forcing her to eat it in front of the class, is child abuse.  If that was my child I'd sue her for everything I could get, but only because it's illegal to kick her rear to the moon.

The look on Romney's face when he was fact-checked by Candy, in front of 60 million viewers, was priceless!! \r\n  \r\nHopefully, he learned his lesson and will show up at the next debate without a pocket full of lies.  \r\n  \r\nBut then, take away the lies and there's nothing for Romney to debate with.....A true predicament he will have to resolve....Hummm \r\n  \r\nI think he will make the same decision he's made regarding his taxes. It's less damaging to not release the taxes than to release them and allow the world to see what a tax cheat he is. \r\n  \r\nSo, Romney will show up with another pocket full of lies, because he knows that to the mindless minions that follow him, telling those lies goes much further than saying nothing at all.

The MOST IMPORTANT part of the story is the last line:  "It suggests that the majority of Americans should not be called upon to solve the nation's fiscal problems. It violates the notion that we are all in this together."  What is wrong with expecting EVERYONE to share in the operation of the government no matter how little they can contribute.  Don't ever expect "Obama the divider" to ever adopt such a stand.....he would lose the votes of the 47%.

I'm surprised no one brought up Obama throws another one under the bus. (Hillary). I can't take another 4 yrs of Obama playing golf and the Cow vacationing on taxpayers money . Get them out of the White House and get the country back to work. Obama also did cut drilling for oil , natural gas  on Federal land if you don't believe me just look at your next fuel bill. They have been cooking the numbers for the past year now esp. this month.\r\n \r\nAnother funny thing the check spell on this when you check out Obama it says Osama. I guess even the spell check knows he's one of them.

These would be 8 more talking points but they are SEALED.  You cannot see them and he does not want to show you.\r\n \r\n1. All college records;\r\n2. Selective service registration.

The reason He and Michelle returned their permit to practice law in Illinois and cannot practice;\r\n6. Law school test scores;\r\n7. Passports;\r\n8. College funding sources (Occidental, Columbia, Harvard, ie. lots of money)\r\n \r\nSince college records were in the first post it does not really count again so just substitute his adoption records.

I was at a Dollar store years ago when my two girls were little. They did not have automatic doors so I was trying to hold the door open and push a full buggie through it when my younger daughter ran in front it. She was heading into the street while I was screaming for her to stop and get myself through the door. There was a car speeding through the parking lot that she could not see because of a car parked on the curb. It would have been perfect timing. As I was screaming I knew that I was getting ready to witness my child getting run over. A homeless man was in the parking lot and started waving his arms at her and shaking his head yelling NOOO! She seen him and stopped immediatly. The car went whizzing by. I got a hold of her and started scolding her all the way to the car. After I got her in, I looked for the guy to thank him and I couldn't find him anywhere. If he wasn't an angel, he was ours.

To be honest I expect to see most of the rich leave the country if you're right, they'll only take most of the money with them. I wonder how well all of the social engineering programs will work when it's just the poor and the poor left here to fend for themselves? When they say "redistribute the wealth," I guess they mean: provide incentives for the money to leave the country.

The issue is not the degree or the person seeking the degree. The issue is simply supply and demand. In the current economic state there just isn't a demand for the degrees listed and many others not listed. I think this article is misleading in that the people seeking the listed degrees are passionate about their work and not necessarily concerned about earning an impressive salary. Most of my high school friends took the business major or communications route and are scrambling to make 40k a year. I choose a vocational route and do far better than them and enjoy what I do. I started out as an apprentice electrician, became very good at what I do, made a name for myself and now work as a controls engineer for a highly respected company. To some of the commenter's saying the trades are a "trap job" I say you're a fool. I'm frequently sought out by "head hunters" for various career opportunities. I could leave my position today and be working anywhere in the world by the end of the month. For me and most everyone working in trades the opportunities for advancement are no different than in the corporate world. Get noticed by the right people and opportunities for advancement follow.

Bush was given an extra term to fix his mess and see where that got us...a worser (yes I made up the word) mess. As far as I see it, Prez Obama isconstantly fighting with a bunch of people in Congress who don't even think about you. Their mission is to see Obama fail (their words exactly). The country is on the way to recovery and the Prez sure as hell cannot fix something in four years that it took eight to broke. So in Novembe....., as I would do if some Democratics were being malicious....I will vote for the guy who truly cares about me and my family because he knows what it feels like to be in need.

If you live in NYC it's certainly middle class.  Also, NYC is the type of place where you're most likely to make that income.\r\n \r\nI worked in midtown Manhattan and made $160,000 per year.  I lived in a tiny studio apartment for $1950 a month.  Nearly half my income went to taxes.  I also had a $2000 a month student loan payment (to get that job I accrued $150,000 in student loan debt).  I did not feel at all like I was living large.\r\n \r\nOh, and btw to get that salary I was working from 8am to midnight or later 6-7 days a week.  Given the grueling hours I had no choice but to live near work.\r\n \r\nWhen we have these debates about what's middle class and what isn't, we really need to specify what part of the country we're talking about.  $250,000 in Manhattan is much different than $250,000 in Kansas City.

Nah... other than the wars... the snowball started rolling with the repeal of the Glass-Steagal act, and the requirements that banks lend to unqualified borrowers because of the "social dream."  Both of these occurred in the 90's.  This wasn't a Republican or a Democrat problem - it was an AMERICAN problem that got way out of control.  \r\n \r\nBut to continue the finger pointing, race-baiting, blaming, responsibility dodging, bowing to foreign leaders... no way.  Our allies don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us.  And our foreign policy is directly tied to our economy based upon the dollars that we have to spend merely to create some false sense of security.\r\n \r\nRomney is a leader with a proven track record of success.  Period.  He's not perfect, he's gaff-prone, and he has made mistakes.  But he cares about America more than himself and can work with others who disagree with him - he proved that by leading in a liberal state with a good deal of success.  Obama has only created hatred, envy, and dissent.  He is NOT a leader; he is a rabble rouser.  \r\n \r\nWE NEED A CHANGE.  If Obama is re-elected, we will NOT be measurably better off in 4 years.  It would not surprise me if we did not actully have civil uprisings.  We have already seen Governors sue the Federal Government, and refuse Federal mandates.  We are in serious trouble here, and it is not about blaming the previous administration, but about creatting a new path for America.  Can Romney do it?  I don't know.  But I know for sure that Obama CANNOT.

The GOP are Sore Losers......From the GOP in Congress to the far right wacko's that vote for them... \r\n When President Obama gave a poor performance in the First Debate, even MSNBC didn't defend him, Chris Matthews even called him out.......  When V.P Biden won his debate, Fox and far right wacko's were sore losers........ When President Obama won last night Fox News were sore losers and so are the far right wacko's on this site... When President Obama won the White House the GOP and far right wacko's were SORE LOSERS.....making him a One Term President and totally Obstruction in Congress by the GOP was their ONLY Goal.....to hell with the American People and Jobs... The GOP wants power when they win, the GOP wants power when they lose an election.....Comprom  ​ ise is not an option.....The GOP wants a ONE PARTY country and they  will screw the American people  to get it......and the simpleminded follow them like puppy dogs...voting against their own best interest's....Amazin  ​ g, simply amazing......

Come on people, Bush got us into this lingering recession, and he is enjoying his retirement with his buddies, that benefited from the war. Stop pointing fingers here and there.  There in no quick remedy for it. and stop saying that your money is a hand up to some looser- addicted-drunk because and that entirely true. What the government takes the government keeps.

Tax consumption not earnings.  Remove all opportunities to avoid consumption tax.  Either that or remove all deductions and move toward a flat tax on earnings.  The tax code is overwhelming to the point the IRS doesn't have the ability to interpret it.  They rely on tax lawyers and accountants who actually work for taxpayers to explain it.  Then they huddle up and decide if they agree.  Government needs to be restrained and simplified.

this dont make sense, when the moderator and Obama interruped and tried to shut Romney up when he started talking about the Libyan attack a large part of the  " undecided " voters in the audience started clapping and cheering, they blew their cover, they were Obama plants

Two basic things are needed for a healthy middle class.  Comprehensive, quality health care and basic social security.  Is that too much to ask for?  This ridiculous idea that the middle class will just have to live off the fallen scraps from the ultra rich is disgusting.  Supposedly this is a majority Christian country.  That idea is about as far from Christianity as you can get.

There is no record to set straight.....so many of you Repubs seem to ignore the crazy wild protests all over the Arab world that were direct results of the silly UTUBE Boob video....all during Obama's speeches he referred to the fact that the US didn't make this silly movie....same with Hillary...that was to quell the protests overseas...then.they  ​  both said that they wanted to get the facts about Libya also.....then Obama and Hillary ALSO took to task ANY acts of terror or attacks against US personnel.....and promised that those who did so would be brought to justice....I'm not changing history....just remembering it as it happened...not as some twisted plot to deceive the populance as you seem to see....PLEASE...calm  ​  down...you guys are way to easy to rile...we'll get the baddies...AND assign blame in the State Dept or the Presidency, if that's where it lies AFTER we get all the facts...

For the middle class to thrive we need jobs,low taxes(Flat or Fair Tax),low inflation,healthy stock and bond markets(build some prisons for crooks on Wall St and Capitol Hill),healthy banks with decent rates of return on saved dollars,fair trade with China,health insurance regulation not socialized medicine,federal debt reduction in real terms (just follow the Simpson/Bowles plan),and common sense social programs.

Not too surprised.  He looks healthier and more active than most guys half his age.  Most people have unhealthy lifestyles that lead to their illnesses and demise.  \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I was always impressed by Anthony Quinn fathering his last child at 83 and with a 19 year old.  :^)

Try putting 3 kids through college without burdening them with student loans. Pay $1400 a month for health insurance. Living in the same house for 22 years barely above water. Trying providing for your own retirement. It takes a lot more than you think.

Haha I just read a few posts and automatically several of you posters, started naming blacks as the cause of the increase when the article doesn't mention race How said. Now here a fact for you. Most serial killers are white males between the ages of 30 and 50. Most child molesters turn out to be white males. Most child abductions are caused by white males. Facts are facts. Criminals come in all sizes and colors.

Fall off the roof of a moving car.   Burn a huge hole in his arm with a cigerette (trying to burn through a twenty).    Walk up to a planter by a hotel doorway in New Orleans (mardi gras), pull the plant out, and say 'look, a plant' while trying to hand it to the NOPD officer that was standing there.  Marry Alice.    Jump out of perfectly good airplanes so we could get closer to people that wanted to kill us.  pull the parking brake while doing however fast a plymouth colt would do. Stand on a piece of plywood tied to a corvair thinking it would be a good substitute for a surfboard.    Run around a pasture (drunk) trying to catch a goat so he could bar-b-que it.  Rope a stop sign from a moving pickup truck.   Sigh.  The good old days.....\r\nI just realized my friends have mental issues.  But damn they are fun!

Yeah...those damn elitists have no right to tell you about history or facts or any of that pesky, overly sensitive stuff. I mean just because something actually means something is no reason you shouldn't be allowed to believe it doesn't, right? What dicks! Next thing you know they'll expect you to learn other stuff too. How dare they pretend that ignorance isn't a virtue!

Romeny is the BEST choice for this country.  Obama has had 04 years for Hope and Change and all he's done is divide and socialize.  He had 02 years of FULL house and senate control and only got Obamacare through which is going to CRIPLE our econmy...  \r\nHe didn't do anything about Ilegal immigaration; \r\nHe didn't do anything about new jobs (still 24M u8nemployed)\r\nHe spent more in 04 years than the last 44 Presidents COMBINED and still adding to deficit of our kids, grandkids and great grandkids...\r\nHe's damn near stopped all FEDERAL land oil and coal production... Only increase is due STRICKLY to States and Private lands of which he has ZERO control.  as a consequence, fuel pricing has DOUBLED which has had direct effect on food, travel, and all other fuel lead industries...\r\nHe's spent 900BILLION  on Solar of which over 50% FAILED and/or were MAJOR campaign contributors to him in 2008 (that's why he's crying now about Republicans out spending him)...\r\nHe GAVE Crysler to forgin auto maker for free...  OH that was novel concept (idiot)\r\nHe GAVE GM to the Unions for unfunded Pension amounts (sound familiar - reoccuring theme to state of USA and why so many FAILED economic system - BS UNION pensions and dues)...\r\nNow the Unions are BK GM (again) as they realize they cannot run it either, thus you'll see another govenment stimuls to GM part 2 if Obama is re-elected.\r\n \r\nO ne\r\nB ig \r\nA ss\r\nM istake \r\nA merica

Rich is a very subjective term. Some think they are rich if they can buy the Yankees{That would be very rich in my opinion}. Some are "rich" if they have their health. {might want a bit more in my humble opinion} \r\nMy wife and I's view falls somewhere near the lower end, but nowhere near the top end.

Brief history lesson, Obey--it wasn't only African Americans who were barred from voting.  It was all "colored people."\r\n \r\nThis included Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic people.\r\n \r\nSome African-Americans speak Gullah.  Yes, this is a language (though it is a creolized language).  Quite a few people in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Florida speak it (it's an island language--these people have been living a subsistence life with little interaction with English culture).\r\n \r\nSome African Americans are also Hispanic--and they speak Spanish. Many people who were being inhibited from voting persisted in speaking their native tongue: Italian, Croatian, Chinese, Spanish, Cherokee, Pennsylvania German (it wasn't only black people being barred from voting--many people considered Portuguese people to be colored, as well as Italians) . . . you name it. One does not have to speak English to be an American citizen--one is allowed the right to express oneself in whatever language one likes.

Don't you just love the way Odumbo tries to always play off like he's not rich? Fact is his net worth is between 12-14 million, and after he leaves office it'll exceed 100 million just like the Clintons. Nothing wrong with him making money, just quit pretending you're struggling  like most of America is under your Presidency.

Using binders for business is a good way of keeping names or resumes in. I use binders to keep track of my projects that I am currently working on and I keep them on my desk or near it. If I were interveiwing several people for several positions it would helpful to keep the resumes in a binder.
