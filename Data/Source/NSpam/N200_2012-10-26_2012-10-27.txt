Just flying 6-8 hours from Boston, Newark, or JFK to Heathrow is too much for me, nowadays.  Until the airlines get real about seating spacing, think my next trip across the pond is going to be by boat.  Slower, but a lot more relaxing, and not much difference as far as cost.  And I'm a pilot.\r\n \r\nBlasted bean counters are getting ridiculous, as well as a few other greedy jerks.  Even the seating on that A-380 doesn't give any real legroom, when travelling any distance.  Airlines are trying to get rich cramming people in like sardines in a can.

I have to give credit to Michelle Bachman when she made this comment on Hardball with Chris Matthews..a few years ago... On MSNBC, she said, “What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look. I wish they would. I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out, are they pro-America or anti-America? I think the American people would love to see an expose like that.” \r\n She did know at the time that the GOP since 2008 is the most Anti-American group of Congressman in the History of the Untied States of America.....

@Raftsnfish: The Salt Lake Tribune, owned by MediaNews Group, and the Deseret News, owned by the LDS Church, have a jointly owned third-party company called MediaOne of Utah that handles print advertising, circulation and distribution for both papers. The editorial boards and newsrooms of The Salt Lake Tribune and Deseret News are completely independent and compete with one another.

Obama isn't on the hook if he doesn't want to be, he's free to act like a punk all he wants.  It just isn't presidential.  Romney isn't slumming around with "celebs" and talking trash, I see a big difference between the two.  But you'd need some class yourself to make that distinguishment.\r\n@Zelda-  lol the hair toss thing was too much!!  Middle school was enough the first time around  =D

@RT I agree, kids should be able to defend them selfs against bullies. If my kid was getting bullied I'd let my child stomp the kid than I'd have my son transfer schools. Than I'd rip the kid myself and have a word with the parents as well. This world can go without teens bullying other teens simply because of the way they dress or rumors spread by ignorant teenagers. The only way to stop a bully is to show them your no longer going to be picked on.

Well, we don't have a shortage of teachers like that in the states either....Too many people are looking at teaching jobs as just that, a job! While there are some quality teachers out there we definitely have those teaching who don't have any patience with children what so ever....I have two teens and live in a fairly wealthy area and trust me, we have those that don't care. However there are those that do a excellent job and communicate with the parents every time the student begins to show signs of problems and are genuinely concerned. Some teachers have this entitlement attitude going on and even take attitude with the principal and the parent and it just irritates me to hell and back. Those teachers who think that teaching is just a job....need to find a new one! \r\n  \r\nI would love to have the authority to clean house, and really who better then a parent who stays involved with their children. I do feel sorry for the teachers who are out there day in and day out doing an excellent job because the ones that aren't are giving schools a bad name.

well i did a little research - some of us actually try to answer questions. the editor is Vern Anderson. while i could not find out his religion, i found an obituary for a Vern Anderson, who has a son named Vern Anderson, all from Salt Lake City, and the elder Anderson was LDS. normally, family does not abandon a religion. so, unless there are a LOT of Vern Andersons in SLC, the chances are pretty good that this editor is LDS. yes, the title of the article is a bit misleading, since the editor, regardless of his religion, does not represent the church, but it's close enough for internet "journalism."

For those of you who are pointing out examples of unpopular people becoming successful  like Bill Gates, I think what needs to be considered is that this study is going to be mainly including people of average intelligence and ambition levels.  Let's face it, the word average means that most people walking the earth are exactly that--average.  Someone like Bill Gates has above average intelligence, and he came from above average wealth levels to begin with.

The teenage years are very hard emotionally and hormonally, and if there are also mental issues, the result can be terrible..... If you look at depression-suicide statistics, women are twice as likely to get depression as men, but men are 7 times more likely to commit suicide. That's a 14-1 difference!... Mental health professionals try to explain the differences with testosterone and hormones (men are much more willing to commit a voilent act).... Yet according to the media it's only "the poor cute teen girls who are terribly bullied" who end up killing themselves.

I'm not sure about Palin being a racist, but she is ignorant and publicity seeking. The comment  has racial overtones. I may not agree with all of the president's ideas, but I think he is very intelligent. I have not agreed with all of the ideas or decisions of any president. The public is much harder on Obama because he is the first African American president. He has done no worse than any other president in office. President Obama really appears to care about this country and he reminds me of Clinton. But then again each of us have said the wrong thing at one time or another.

Decider...In my day it was accepted by the teachers to let the kids work it out. One time I broke a kid's nose in the 9th grade for messing up my hair. Right after I hit him I looked up at the Gym teacher and he pretended like he didn't see a thing. I fought all the time in those tough schools and never got punished for it. My son defended himself in the 4th grade and was going to be put in detention. I talked the principle out of it. It's all about law suits. It has to stop.

Victoria: This actually takes money from the middle class and the poor and allows the rich to keep their money in the bank while the taxpayers pick up their nursing home tab. As of now, Medicaid will pick up the tab based on financial need. If Medicare picks it up everyone gets it, including the millionaires at taxpayers cost and we all run out of money for Medicare. Everyone will and does get care, no one is rejected. It is just a matter if the patient pays for it or the taxpayers do. This story is very misleading. It makes it sound like elderly are not able to go to nursing homes, but there are plenty of poor people in nursing homes.

Nope.  I am not so sure that children are that discerning.  It may be more a matter that they are less inhibited.

The bill as it is currently written should have been withdrawn. However, the basic premise behind it (as in minus the whole rape bit) is pretty good. If someone is already being supported by taxpayers, I support having some way (within reason) to discourage them from having more children for the taxpayers to support.

Republicants:  If you can't blame Obama for Upchucks salary going down, or his healthcare costs going up, both of which are reality for him, then logically,  you can't give Obama credit for your healthcare costs staying the same and your salary going up, unless you belong to a union company that might have some special favor with Obama, which of course would be a skewed view to begin with. \r\n  \r\nHome values are still spotty, and the report just today showed a very weak number for new housing starts.  Unemployment is going down, but only if you believe that creating 114,000 jobs drops the unemployment rate nationally by 3 tenths of a percent in one month.  But, of course, it's much easier to get it down when thousands continue to drop out and the participation rate is in the toilet.  Not to mention that Obama has begged certain companies to hold off notifying their employees of coming layoffs until after the election. \r\n  \r\nSo, you can't get by with telling just half the story on what you percieve to be good news.  If you only look at the positive side and don't question the whys behind the numbers, then it's easy to believe things are getting better.  On they other hand, reality, and I mean the real situation Upchuck faces everyday, tells him otherwise. \r\n  \r\nAll I'm saying is just look at both sides and then make an objective opinion about the situation.

We just went through this denial from Medicare.  My husband has Alzheimers and is losing his mobility.  Medicare would not pay because there was no chance of him getting better - just worse.  Glad to hear that this may be in place for him.  He falls constantly because his balance is so bad.  He's been in the hospital numerous times because of these falls.  This may keep him out of the hospital!  We will never use up the amount we paid into Medicare during our working years!  That was my original argument with Medicare when I called for benefits.

Swag, you only think people don't realize....we all went through that phase though. It can be rough, but it gets better. \r\n \r\nThe sad thing is, teenagers, being inexperienced, think every issue is the end of the world, they don't understand that all things pass with time. Social awkwardness is no reason to harm yourself or others. Just do your own thing and ignore the haters and carry on with your head high. \r\n \r\nAnd if you see someone being harrased like this poor girl, maybe stick up for them, you never know, it could save their life.

Absolutely! Tank should have been escorted out of that restaurant. There is no excuse for that type of behavior and it shouldn't be tolerated. That the tirade was directed at a vet who fought to protect us and lost his legs in the process makes this story even more disturbing. Everyone in that restaurant should have stood up and handled this jerk. And to the vet, I am sorry you were treated this way. Thank you for serving our country. I for one appreciate your service to our country and am so sorry you suffered such a loss and suffered the ravings of an ungrateful bully,and a jerk.

i have been following a lot of former GOP leaders, especially some of Reagan's advisers, even though I am a liberal democrat, because i started to see in the media this backlash of true conservatives against the fundamentalist turn with the tea party. i  honestly feel bad, because having your political party hijacked by a bunch of loonies doesn't help the US. when arlen specter died (i'm from PA and live back here now), i was reminded of what a moderate republican looks like. he lost his seat because of the tea party, after serving this nation for 30 years. the tea party's mantra of "throw the bums out" shows that they don't even try to figure out who is doing good and who isn't, they will just vote out anyone, and put any RWNJ in their place. i think we are heading towards a time, in this next election cycle, when we can have a 3rd and even 4th party come to prominence - the fiscal-conservative,  ​  non fundy Republicans, and the far-left Democrats are not represented in today's US (despite what most of these tea party people think, obama is NOT anywhere near liberal). if i was a republican, i would lay on my leadership to get back to being americans and not fundy terrorists.

I don't think her comments were racist .  Could it have had a racist overtone, maybe?  The fact is that it’s slang that was predominately used in the Black community years ago. Realize that it’s the 21st century now and many things have crossed ethnic barriers, music, clothes food. and  the way we use language.  "You go girl" was an ethnic thing but all women and some men use it now.  No one should feel offended by this.  The term is something rarely used now and pretty much out of date and a little lame if you ask me.  Just another example how much Sara is out of touch with the rest us.

If man sprang from the monkey,he ought to spring once more and make it a safe distance. See what four years on the streets can do to you. He will probably get life in a cage.

If slavery is still affecting your life today, go get help! Please tell me how it alters what you do in your day to day life,being that you were never a slave..and how that gives you more of a right to be racist than it does for white people? A white person is racist and by god they need shot! A black person is a racist and its ok,they have every right today because there was ONCE slavery.....you are a hypocrite!

the man has a point,i don't know why obama has to be so private about everything in his past. it seems that he has a lot to hide or he would be forth coming about all the questions. truth is our pres. thinks he is not accountable to anyone or for anything he does.when this man if elected runs this country in the ground and we all end up as third world citizens. maybe,just maybe the people he fooled into putting him in office will realize what a life changing mistake they have made.

Really, who else was available, Santorum, Bachman, Gingrich, ??? Ironically the only republican that was worthy of my vote was another Mormon, Huntsman !!! thanks The GOP repudiated him for serving his country under Obama.

Unfortunately large banks don't really care about the customer. I don't mean those on the front lines like tellers, or those working the submittal of loans but the people you don't see like the Bank Manager, the loan processor. I am now approaching 8 months since applying for a re-fi with US Bank. Still not funded. There excuse, we are understaffed, and had not done these types of loans before (heart loan for a property underwater) . Strangely enough they came after me. Why do you solicit business if you don't know how to do it?

Two plus two equals four. The math still says if you get more benefits from your insurance you will get higher premiums. (or taxes to pay for it) There still isn't any free lunch.

"Shuck and jive" has moved from wherever it may have originated, having something to do with African-Americans, into general parlance, just like "shtick."  (Nobody thinks Palin's suggesting Obama's a secret Jew.) \r\n  \r\nWithout winning supermajorities of black votes, Democrats are toast, forever.  Therefore they spend inordinate amount of time trying to convince minorities that white people hate them.  Which goes a long way (more so than actual racism, which has been beaten back to a few inbreds with little to no influence on society) towards explaining the alienation and resentment in disadvantaged minority communities, which discourages many of their young men from participating in mainstream civic and economic life, leading so many of them to murder each other.  Whether you like it or not, you race-baiting Democratic sociopaths, you have minority blood on your hands.

The "Silent Majority" rose to the occasion. Chick-fil-A is a real American kind of Company. Marriage is for one Man and one Woman in my book.Imagine what the world would be like if the majority of people were gay.

there was an article recently.  The fine, er tax will be $1,200.  that should take a bite into yer income tax refund.  \r\nHere's your out.  I am a member of the holy religous order of the filet mignon.  We do not believe in doctors, We believe when you are sick to pray for healing.  If your an athiest, then drink a six pack. but you will have to notify the govt of your exclusion.  \r\n \r\nAnd guess what!  Obama care is already being used.  If you go to the doctari, used to be he would make out a prescription and off you go.  \r\nNow the doctor has to list all the ailments so the insurance will pay on the prescription.  Thats obamathreat in action.  \r\nNow if i go to your doctari and ask what is wrong with you, i will be told, cant tell you privacy act, however now, EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG WITH YOU will be sent to some idiot who will verify that the drug you were prescribed is for the ailment you have.  This is already happening.  It aint gonna happen in 2014.  So thanks to Ovomit, my privacy is being invaded, as my ailments are being broadcast to people who have no right to know whats wrong with me.  \r\nAnd the libs keep saying the cons keep infringing on our rights. \r\nNot to mention, what if you doctor does not use the 'MAGIC WORD' or even better the person is having a bad hair day and the prescriptions you have been given are not filled? \r\n \r\nWhy do the canadians come here for health care? Because they already got ovomitcare and we actually have some pretty good doctors and hospitals here in comparison to other places.\r\nGovernment run health care is what the military has.  Been in the dysfuntional family.  Got sick and had a chest cold.  Went to see the doctari.  He asked me what was wrong. I told him.  He then asked me,what do they usually give you for this.  So  i told him. he wrote the scripts.  I asked him why he did not know what meds to give me.  He answered, in the condition your in i have no idea what to do with you.  I asked him why.  He said he was a coroner and they had to pull er duty.  Thats govt run health care. \r\nCourse the only businesses the govt currently runs are the army, which we are borrowing money to keep it going and the post office which is bankrupt.  and we want to add health care to this mess.  Ovomit cant even balance the budget.

The idea of intraterrestrials was brilliant.  Twin Peaks underworld realm evokes a eerie feeling of childhood magical thinking that fits in well with fairy tale realms, shamanic aboriginal "dream time" and the feeling that this "consensus reality" is only one of many (and it's always only held together tentatively). I feel that there is much more that might have been done in the series to develop these themes. \r\n \r\nIf as some modern physicists now suspect matter and energy turn out to be only special forms of information then our modern worldview's absolute faith in "materialism" may soon be proven wrong. Some may be ready to explore the greater possibilities but most of us will feel safer imagining that the our old worldview of the separation of mater, energy and information is still intact. It's nice to imagine that some things are only make believe.

When you support hate speech and act like the very Nazis, Communists, Socialists, and Fascists that you claim to hate, Sandra McDonald (Sandra NJ), then you are honestly no better than them.  Oh, and by the way, do you own a rival business that isn't doing too well thanks to them competing against you?  If that's the case, then you need learn to either roll with the punches and become more competitive or shut your hole and find another line of work.
