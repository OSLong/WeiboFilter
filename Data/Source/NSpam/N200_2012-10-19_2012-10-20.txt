@ Zoe, "I wonder how many ultra-religious zealots live by "The Rulebook" I'm betting none. They just pick the pieces they like". \r\n \r\nIndeed, most modern variations of Christianity are basically this because the original source contains things not sociably acceptable in our culture; Even though that basically means they’re disobeying their own religion).

I have compassion for people who are truly poor but I've worked with people who claim to be poor single parents that get all the goodies plus eic on their tax return which makes them get between 5k and 7k back. The problem I have is when they live with a boyfriend who is making 50grand or more a year. That's why sometimes you see them with their nails done, hair professionally colored, and wearing nice jewlery, or driving nice cars. It's even worse when they have a blended family and both making the same as a married couple. He gets to claim the kids they had together as a single parent and she gets to claim her kids from a previous relationship and they end up both gettin eic and a big fat check each from the irs. If they were legally married theyd be lucky to get about 1000 back. You see, some people live on the same income as others, but because some choose to shack up they get a lot more gov. assistance then those who marry and have to claim both incomes. I guess thats why they call it the marriage penalty. I've been in the workforce for over 20 years and I see this ALOT.

Perhaps it would be good to compare the incomes earned with the amount of taxes paid in.  To me it would help to see the picture of who is giving a "fair share" by  what the average percentage of income is paid as taxes(relative to earnings)  Also, how does this amount relate to other income groups?  It is too easy to say people don't pay enough, but if they already pay a huge portion of the taxes paid and we are still hundreds of billions short of what we are spending.... Lets have a revolution and take all the assets of the top 5%!  Then everybody can have a debit card with $300 bucks on it and go out and buy cigarettes and booze.

It's very simple why 250 k is the number used. Small business owners can be screwed by taxes and this number is high enough that everyone should be able to agree for higher taxes. As mentioned many times here, very few people make more than 250,000.\r\n \r\nI find the writer to be an instigating PoS that doesnt have the courage to post under their real name though. Twelve years of tax breaks have greatly increased the wealth of the top 5% and I never saw them 'share the wealth'. So why should I be upset if they have to suddenly pay more? We aren't in this all together. There is the haves, have-nots, and have everythings. Paying 14% of your pay should be the rate of McDonald's workers, not millionaires. Just like the free loaders, the rich arent owed any special benefits for being rich. They are rich lol! What more do they truly need?\r\n \r\nLets get the freeloaders back to work, the rich back to paying 35%, and give tax incentives to the companies that hire americans not the other way around.

Old Testament.  It had to do with being religiously unclean, as people were not allowed to touch anyone who was openly bleeding or be considered unclean for the entire day.  To prevent accidentally touching others within their camp (remember, back then they lived in tents), women lived outside the camp in a separate tent during that week.  They all lived outdoors, so living outside on the lawn is a moot point.  Once their period stopped, they bathed and changed their clothing so that they would be ceremonially clean again, and then rejoined everyone else in the main camp.  It was a total cultural and Jewish thing.  It has nothing to do with Christianity, unless you want to live under the Law of the Old Testament.\r\n \r\nOn a separate note, living outside isn't all that bad, if you plan ahead to take care of your physical needs.  I worked at a wilderness camp, and I lived outside for almost 5 years.  We certainly didn't take the Bible out of context and try to revive some ancient Jewish customs, though.  We simply applied Christianity to living outside in modern-day America.  Not so weird.  Plenty of homeless people do it.  It's not that hard, if you plan right.

And I've been around a LOT of "poor people" all through the 80's when I was making crap wages at TWO jobs, I had to live in lousy neighborhoods to AFFORD MY rent and trust me, NONE of these folks were driving anything at that time which would be a Escalade or better. You all need to get off this reincarnation of the "Reagan WELFARE QUEEN" lie that people on foodstamps have fancy cars, big screen TVs and all that BS.  It is simply NOT TRUE. Most welfare mothers cannot even AFFORD a car, at least the ones I lived around for years.  Cut the crappola!!!!

Fellucio-  "All the rich, greedy pigs" , "It's not too much to ask them that they give something back to that society for making it possible for them to succeed."\r\n\r\nWhat makes you say they don't give back? And why the hatred about calling them greedy?? Do the people who take the initiative, make success for themselves, and contribute most to society deserve any compensation for their hard work? Do you know how many different organizations we donate to every year? Just something for you to think about.

And yet surprisingly they are all perversions and sins that are listed in The Holy Bible.  Pedophilia, homosexuality, bestiality, incest, are all just a few of the perversions and sins listed in The Holy Bible.  If you want to know the truth, get your Bible and look it up.  The Holy Bible also says that homosexuality is a perversion of the mind, and no matter how many people tell homosexuals how wrong and evil what they are doing is, they will never listen to God and his righteousness!!!!

Also, when I was a child, growing up in Florida in a 3 bedroom, 1 bath home without AC with 4 children and 2 adults, I thought my friend who lived down the street who had a window AC unit and didn't get Xmas gifts from yard sales was "rich". "Rich" depends on your perspective. I don't have maids, I couldn't afford to retire if I wanted to (no matter what lifestyle I chose), I don't have multiple houses in multiple states, I have a pool, but I clean it myself. I do not feel sorry for myself or anyone in my position. I am happy and do not need more. But I am by no reasonable definition "rich".

This is why companies like to report earnings after hours... people overreact and this creates a major selloff. That being said... this usually means a buying opportunity. Considering the high valuations that are given to companies like Google, any misstep will cause a big stir.  Just remember, they can move up just as fast.

These reports paint an awful picture of molestation, showing much pain and anguish to say the least. Yes, where was law enforcement to protect and serve?  I was in a scout group for awhile in my hometown in the mid 1950s and the thought of predators around was out of mind, unheard of.  I was always cautious around strange acting  strangers, to say the least.  In jr h.s. and on sex predators were never mentioned among any adults but most of us had heard of incidents that happened to others.  In the army at 18 in early '61 I heard of perverts out there with some of the old army slang terms.

That's not right & if I was her mom I would  make sure I see something in writing that states what the punishment is if  u return a book late. Their crushing this girl especially considering she's a freshman in HS it's important for her to go to dances & participate in other activities so she'll meet more people & feel comfortable within the high school since freshman have a hard time adjusting sometimes & some are really shy. The principal & whoever made up this rule should be ashamed of themselves, they have no heart & if their going to punish kids for little things then the kids eventually will brake more serious rules knowing something so small or big u still get into trouble.

To all of you who believe that these T-Shirts aren't offesive and that the philosophy behind "Manifest Destiny" wasn't genocide and that all us Native Americans are just hypersensitive, should go take a Native American Studies class and educate yourselves a little more before you start calling us names and attacking our beliefs. My grandmothers and grandfathers gave up their lives because of the concept behind "Manifest Destiny". My great grandmother was forcefully taken from her parents at the age of 7 and sent off to boarding school where she was beaten if she spoke Dakota, even though she didn't know how to speak English. Our language, ceremonies, our culture was outlawed until the 1970's. My great great grandfather fought for this country in WW1 even though he wasn't considered an U.S. citizen. My grandfather was expelled from school at the 8th grade because he didn't learn English. My children who attend public school have to deal and learn to tolerate kids who call them "Prairie Niggers" everyday. So for those of you who think that we are "entitled" go visit a reservation here in the Midwest or research one and come back and let me know just how entitled you think we are!!!

It is also OBAMA who has said repeatedly "he does not need a tax cut" and has SHOWN HIS TAXES BEFORE becoming President and has fully disclosed them all ever sincew while greedy Robme says "what he pays is FAIR at 14%" while the creep also had the audacity to sit in a coffee shop with unemployed people LIVING off UI checks; "Well, I'm ALSO unemployed" and he techincally HAS been since being a ONE TERM GOVERNOR in MA leaving that state LOADED with debt.  \r\nSo here is someone that not only has not WORKED in years, just keeps making millions off of his MILLIONS, refuses to disclose more then 2 years of INCOMPLETE inccome taxes since 2011, we're ALL still waiting for from the richest man ever to run for President.  This liar and greed monger has NO BUSINESS being NEAR the WH-EVER!!!!!  I sure don't get "capital gains and dividends" as he claimed middle class people all have according to MORE of his lies in the second debate. The fact is, different set of rules for people like HIM and US? Make our lives that much more impossible with his draconian policies.

I must have been in poverty my whole life, in my house we make well less than $55,000 a year and my husband and I both have two jobs. I understand the welfare and food stamp situation, unfortunately, I have had to dip into the "pot" before for food stamps while my husband and I were struggling. We definately were not buying steaks, we were buying all the food for our child with the money. I actually felt embarassed to swipe my card, I guess because I knew at that point We were really poor and struggling and people around us knew it...too... We definately don't drive a nice car...but my "little red" gets it done. oh, and my phone is not smart at all, no camera, no internet, no txt only voice. Needless to say, not all people are trying to rape the system or claim fraudulant income. Agreed, the agency that give these subsidaries need to police it alittle more.

Kjairusa, I was not "kvetching", I was explaining how $250K sounds like more than it is. As I said, I make a decent living, and I am happy to make it. I do not live in as affluent of a neighborhood as you obviously think. I did not say my children go to a $40K per year school, I said the total cost of sending 2 children is $40K - this is to a public university, and if you think you can find a school with $3K per semester costs these days, you have got to be kidding!!  And, ummm... No, Obama did not sign into law anything that affects the cost or repayment of my student loans. What he signed into law only affects new student loans to current students (which my children do not qualify for because "I make too much money"). There are a whole lot of misconceptions being repeated on here.

I think $250,000 can be considered upper middle in a lot of regions.  For example, if you are a police officer in Washington, D.C. and work a ton of overtime and your wife is a nurse and works a lot of overtime then you are over 250,000.  Does that make you rich? I do not think so especially in a region where the housing market is high and cost of living is high.  Now, in some other parts of the country is that rich? i am sure it is. I just feel people around this income should not be taxed more than 28%.

As a young mother, my son got to close to the river where his Grandparents lived.  Our cocker spaniel pulled my son away from the edge of the embankment that goes to the water.  She was a fat spaniel and very strong. She dragged him quite a bit until someone saw him and her. My son's little hand was hitting her the whole time she pulled his britches towards the house.  As a child, different cocker spaniel, mixed in fact, but looked full blooded saved my life. I went onto a porch next door and a dog was asleep & I evidently woke him up and he was startled and he bite my leg. I was age 8 or 9 and had played with the dog numerous times. My fat, lazy spaniel was on the porch next door rushed over and started fighting with the dog and I was able to get away from him biting me.  I have a large scar on my leg still to this day, age 63 now.  So when someone says their dog won't bite you, don't believe them.  A dog is a dog, pedigree or mixed and under the right circumstances will bite you or anyone else.

If you make 250K to 500K you'll pay more under Obama or Romney.  If you make millions or billions you'll pay almost nothing under Romney.\r\n \r\nUnder , Mitt Romney wouldn’t pay any taxes for the next ten years — or any of the years after that. Now, do I know that that’s true. Yes, I’m certain. Well, maybe not quite nothing. In 2010 — the only year we have seen a from him — Romney would have paid an effective tax rate of around 0.82 percent under the Ryan plan, rather than the he actually did. How would someone with more than $21 million in taxable income pay so little? Well, the vast majority of Romney’s income came from capital gains, interest, and dividends. And Ryan wants to eliminate all taxes on capital gains, interest and dividends. Romney, of course, when Newt Gingrich proposed it back in January by pointing out that zeroing out taxes on savings and investment would mean zeroing out his own taxes.  Almost. Romney did earn $593,996 in author and speaking fees in 2010 that would still be taxed under the Ryan plan. Just not much. Ryan would cut the top marginal tax rate from 35 to 25 percent and get rid of the Alternative Minimum Tax — saving Romney another $292,389 or so on his 2010 tax bill. Now, Romney would still owe self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees, but that only amounts to $29,151. Add it all up, and Romney would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, for a cool effective rate of 0.82 percent. But what about corporate taxes? Aren’t they a double tax on savings and investment, so Romney’s “real” rate is higher than his headline rate? No. As of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has pointed out, Romney has structured his investments as “pass-throughs” that avoid corporate tax. In other words, the 0.82 percent tax rate is really a 0.82 percent tax rate. It might seem impossible to fund the government when the super-rich pay no taxes. That is accurate. Ryan would actually raise taxes on the bottom 30 percent of earners, according to the nonpartisan , but that hardly fills the revenue hole he would create. The solution? All but eliminate all government outside of Social Security and defense — a point my colleague has made in incredible chart form.  Maybe that Romney didn’t pay taxes for a decade was really a time-traveler from the future. If Romney wins, it could very well be true.

It's unavoidable, and an inevitable reality that many people always judge by looks alone.  Since a neck and knee injury from a fall, I haven't worked out like I used to.  I've packed on the pounds and find that I can't get service at some places, while it's affected my sales at work.  I've carefully observed how people react to my thinner friends or co-workers, and I know it's the weight for the most part.  I am one of the most competent and knowledgeable in my company where we sell luxury items, but find that my buyers pay less attention to what I'm saying about the merchandise since I've gained weight.  As I see the results of my new diet and exercise routine, I don't doubt I'll get a different reaction from people.  I agree with ktyfn2008, let's all agree to not judge each other.

If I was a boy's father, I'd be very concerned....the wives, kids,   and family members of these exposed "Johns" are in one hell of a mess and it will be awful quiet in some of those homes.  The "Zumba Madam"  is hardly attractive, to say the least.   I would think by now most men know that any massage parlor, escort service etc. probably have hidden cameras installed that video every encounter, esp full contact workouts between men and their hired partners.  An old fear is being ripped off as in having a wallet and watch stolen by a goon or pimp  at gunpoint. Wise up, men!

DM,\r\n\r\n I am very intrigued by your post. A few weeks ago I read one and thought it was a standalone comment, but now realize you have been doing this for months. As a counselor this brings me great concern which I would like to talk with you about offline, if possible.\r\n \r\n Please let me explain, often people become upset by routes in life that don’t work out. Venting and warning others is useful. This is healthy and good. Where it becomes insalubrious is when the intensity of blaming others or a corporation cultivates into obsessed anger while personal responsibility is not accepted. \r\n \r\n Furthermore, blaming an inanimate corporation shows displacement and guilt which is often associated to emotional matters. When you vent continually about hiring the wrong broker it leads me to believe something much larger is at your core. +70 posts start to solidify this premonition. Please understand my feelings are sympathetic. Just be careful that you lashing out doesn’t manifest into an adjustment disorder. \r\n \r\n While it is common to need months or even years to feel normal after adjusting to life situations and events (i.e. loss of spouse, divorce, health concern) personal attributes can also stall the healing process. i.e. Poor or negative self-image becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consider a spouse who becomes frustrated enough to leave after dealing with their partners personality weaknesses for numerous years. \r\n \r\n So, if you are turning to technology as an outlet to reclaim control please be very careful. Especially, if the problems you are dealing with in the physical world are not getting adequate attention. \r\n \r\n Feel free to let me know if you are interested in talking further. \r\n \r\n Luke

We may not be as great as we once were but the American greenback still packs a wallop in world markets. Our congress will moan and complain ( both parties), but we realize what the consequences of doing nothing will be. Then again, BO might not?

I have to agree with most of what they said about Thailand. Rent is indeed very reasonable there and the food is dirt cheap and very tasty. The medical care is also very good and cost a fraction of what it does here in the USA. Still, with rent of only $400 a month I’m not sure why this Larry guy needs nearly $2000 a month to live in Chiang Mai unless he’s spending $1000 a month on women. Also it should be pointed out that these places are becoming less and less of a deal every day as the US dollar get weaker and weaker. The first time I went to Thailand about 15 years ago I could get about 44 Baht per US dollar, but the last time I lived there I only got about 30 Baht for that same dollar. Also, for people like me who prefer to live in Phuket and be near the beach things are much more expensive than in Chiang Mai. Still if I were not such a beach lover I would definitely choose Chiang Mai as its cooler, cheaper, less humid, and has perhaps the best food in all of Thailand.

Under Romney's plan a Surgeon making $600,000 a year would pay around $177,000 on that $600,000 the same $177,000 as Romney on over $21,000,000. Does anyone really think that's fair? Nothing Romney proposes is about those making $250,000 or $500,000. It's about him and people like him. The argument that people are after the money from those making around 250K is absurd,  Nothing Obama proposes would increase it a penny and only a few percent for money earned above that. Quit drinking the Kool aid.

You are a terrible person for assuming someone is weak because they're fat. Many people can't help it. I was diagnosed with severe bronchial asthma in 2005 and ever since then my doctors have been giving me steroids claiming that it's the only thing that can help me. Guess what, steroids make you fat! My doctors never fail to give me a(n) injection of steroids or a month long steroid pack of pills to take and then tell me "oh...your fat you need to lose weight!" Thank you ****! Clearly, I was unaware! Thank you for making it physically impossible to do anything but GAIN weight! This has got to stop. Just like it's wrong to use the N word It should also be equally as wrong to judge someone because they're too fat or too skinny.  People are sick and what did they do wrong? Nothing at all, other than be sick or take medicine that keeps them alive. Not every person who is fat or too thin is that way by choice, and able to change it. And you are a hypocrite for thinking so! Many people (myself included) would give an arm and a leg to be their correct healthy weight. But we can't, and there's nothing we can do about it. I only have 2 choices. 1. stay fat. or 2. stop taking my medications and die by an asthma attack. But hey at least I'll be thin and pretty right? (sarcasm)

I don't understand why she couldn't breast feed her children, but can a dog. Also whyis she still breast feeding the dog after 2 years? She must have severe emotional problems.

The numerous reports of dogs waking people up, in the middle of the night, when the house is on fire. The bond between the human and dog is very deep and ancient.
