Love #4, as part of my shoe collection.  Would never wear any of them...makes me angry that they are even considered  women's accessories.  I'd like to see any of  the designers wear them around for a couple hours.

Actually, prostitution across state lines, or between the US and another country, is a violation of the federal Mann Act 1U.S.C. §§ 2421-2424.  Apparently the pimp was on parole, and as someone has already pointed out the conditions of parole may be less burdensome than prison, but they are based on the notion that the person on parole has received grace, but is still subject to the terms of imprisonment.  A prisoner doesn't have all the rights of a non-convict.  Similarly with someone on parole.

Readalot-That is a bunch of crap. Pure BS. Quit making excuses for them already.  That is All your doing is making Excuses for them. \r\nIf black people want white people to stop using the word ****. Then black people need to stop using it themselves. If not, tough. Is their intelligence level That low that they can't comprehend that, if you want everyone to stop using a word, then stop using it yourself. If they can't understand that, either one, raise your intelligence level higher than 8th grade and comprehend what you are asking everyone else to do, and do it yourself, or sit around complaining when everyone else keeps using it cause you are.  Black people have one standard for all the rest of us, high, political correct, can't make Any mistake. While having a different standard for themselves, they get to do what they want and not care.

Ta_khent, could you please explain how your post about consumption relates to my post about whether masses of people with firearms can do considerable damage, which was in response to V_L.  Yes, we consume, we are a consumer driven economy, and now we don't produce as much as we consume because of outsourcing.  But guess what, we don'rt consume as much as we used to, we don't have the money, and thus there are fewer jobs, and people are getting hungry and desperate, and if they have weapons, and they decide to get even, look out.  It seems you may be talking cause, but I'm talking effect.

After the divorce, I lived on my 32 ft. sailboat for a few years. A big orange stray cat that hung around the docks, decided he liked to sail and moved aboard. About the same time as the divorce I also lost my job,  so I took what little money I had left and started sailing up and down the west coast. Captain Morris (the cat) turned out to be a great sailor and companion. We sailed to Hawaii (where he never got off the boat) and on the return trip our first landfall was Monteray Harbor. We both had our "sea-legs",  but walking on a dock that didn't move proved difficult until we got our "land-legs" back. A group of people partying on a boat in the harbor roared with laughter as the cat and I came staggering down the docks looking like a couple of drunk sailors.

YES! \r\n    Mormons on their missions do not serve the United States of America. They serve their church.  The Romney boys should've delayed going on their missions until after serving time in the military. Ann lives in a male dominated religion where women are treated as second class citizens. She will blindly follow her husband and bishop. By listing to her talk about things you can see what Mitt is really like.\r\n    I am not a Mormon, but I know many who are. I do know that Mormons gave up bigamy a long, long time ago. The group of Mormons who still practice bigamy are called Fundamentalists.  They would probably stop it if they had to support all of their wives and children by themselves instead of getting government money and assistance.\r\n     Personally I don't like Romney or Obama. I will vote for the unknown third presidential candidate or put myself in as a write in candidate.\r\n \r\n    I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR MILITARY MEN & WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED OUR GREAT COUNTRY.

First, HIS country (the U.S.) declares that he and his family are possible spies so they lock them up in a detention camp.  He then volunteers to fight for the country that locked him up, while his family remains locked up and when the war was over and he was able to come home, they finally released his family without so much as a "sorry!"  \r\n\r\nThis gentleman goes far beyond the term "HERO!"  If all Americans had this fine American's honor, courage and dignity, we would all be much better off right now.  \r\n\r\nMr. Tanabe, you are a truly great American and an inspiration to us all!

Where were the cries of racism and "hate crime"? Where was Al Sharpton? He is very quick to descend on so-called white-on-black "hate crimes". Guarantee he'll be on this one like a fly stuck to fly-paper.

Wow. football players and cheerleaders are so cool.  Is their any way they could look cooler?\r\nmaybe!  Think about it, what if, at halftime, we had a BAND perform on the field?\r\nBut, bands are cool!  Guitars wailing, drums pounding...\r\nNo,No, not a cool band, an UNCOOL band!  You know, like trombones and clarinets and all the other loser crap instruments!\r\nWhoa!  That would make the football players and cheerleaders seem even cooler!  Good idea!\r\nOh wait!  It gets better!  What if we put them in 'uniforms'?\r\nHuh?  Uniforms?  But the military is cool.  They keep us safe.\r\nNo, man.  Not cool military uniforms....The gayest, weirdest uniforms you can imagine!  Like weird big hats and stuff like that!\r\nNo way!  That would be so totally suck, the football players and cheerleaders would look WAY COOL compared to that!\r\nHa!  And then we could make them march around the field like idiots!  That would be hilarious!\r\nNah.  No one would be such a loser that they would be willing to do that.....\r\n \r\nOh, and how about we get those losers to haze each other to death......

Yeah keep paying IDIOTS like Ryan Seacreast an enormous amount, which HE IS NOT #$%$%$ WORTH!!!!  You're such an IDIOT NETWORK!!  Why don't you just go out and find TALENTED HOSTS, then at least you could consider yourself worthy -- There are MILLIONS of talented people in PR, broadcasting who can do the job BETTER!!!!  As far as Mariah and Nicki -- you DESERVE LOSING VIEWERS FOR GETTING CLASSLESS AND DISGUSTING PEOPLE LIKE THEM!  I'll stick to "ME TV because they have the BEST all time show, as well as Hallmark (I Love Lucy) -- Now those shows have CLASS AND TALENT!!!!

Idol didn't lose it's audience because of competition from other talent shows. They drove their audience away with poor decisions. After the loss of their original judges they have yet to come up with a credible panel of judges. They have made it clear they are more interested in boosting the careers of fading artists than in discovering and promoting new talent. They have made it clear they will never fix a voting system that can be manipulated by organized voting blocks, thus skewing the results to give us winners who are neither the most talented nor the most popular contestants. They also seem to have little interest in effectively promoting the careers of those contestants they sign to recording contracts after the show. After 12 seasons only two winners have gone on to major recording success, along with some non-winners who number is so small they can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The most recent of those, Adam Lambert was the runner up on Season 8, so that means the last four seasons have produced no major recording artists. The judging panel for the upcoming season 13 seems more like a desperate flail th****gitimate effort to make the show about finding and cultivating talent again. There was a time when I thought I'd be enjoying Idol for many years to come, but no more. I can't think of a reason to watch the train wreck it has become.

This is why we can't allow Mitt and the racists who support him to win November 6th. Mississippi is one of the two worst states in the country. Alabama being the other. No Black people and definitely white person should live in either state.

Most of the contestants are really boring. The tryouts in different cities, is the best part of the show. The decline started when Reuben Studdard won over Clay Aiken. It's pretty much been downhill since. Too many computer programs available for people to stack the vote. The judges don't  add anything to the show. I will not watch this year as I can't imagine Nicky Minaj will be an asset.

Not at all concerned...  I'm certain that all the lost data is going to churches, synagogues, and the Society For The Advancement of Ethical Culture. Another reason for my lack of concern has to do with the fact that I do not send sensitive data out over my telephone -- Android, iPhone, telegraph, or you name it. That's how Germany got us into the first world war.

"The internet reverberated"?  I haven't felt any aftershocks . . .\r\n \r\nGet a life.  It's the actions of news reporters manufacturing stories that cause the bad feelings.  Any adult - mature, self critical, responsible person regardless of age - who grasped the story as a gestalt would comprehend that Chase was using the word as part of a criticism of poor character writing and composition, rather than as anything he himself would say.  That, however, wouldn't gather any page views.  The back story here is that of reporters and editors who are pushing this; who are self-serving venal individuals creating bogus racial events to using racism to benefit themselves.

I rescued a baby kitten, and raised him with my two dogs.  One day while I was in the kitchen, I saw my dog, Chaps, walk by with a chew stick heading for the living room.  A few moments later, Sam, the kitten, heads toward the same area.  The next thing I hear is this terrific growl from Chaps, and I see Sam bolting like lightening from the living room.  Sacred one of his nine lives away.......

Joe, you re a suicide waiting to happen, not saying I encourage it, but at some point you will realize you that the weight of this rhetoric combinded with your blatant mental illness will drive you over the edge. My advice? Get help while you still can. Respect the Bible, but try reading a different book or two...

MYTH # 4\r\n LGBT people don't live nearly as long as heterosexuals. \r\nTHE ARGUMENT\r\n Anti-gay organizations want to promote heterosexuality as the healthier "choice." Furthermore, the purportedly shorter life spans and poorer physical and mental health of gays and lesbians are often offered as reasons why they shouldn't be allowed to adopt or foster children. \r\nTHE FACTS\r\n This falsehood can be traced directly to the discredited research of Paul Cameron and his , specifically a 1994 paper he co-wrote entitled, "The Lifespan of Homosexuals." Using obituaries collected from gay newspapers, he and his two co-authors concluded that gay men died, on average, at 43, compared to an average life expectancy at the time of around 73 for all U.S. men. On the basis of the same obituaries, Cameron also claimed that gay men are 18 times more likely to die in car accidents than heterosexuals, 22 times more likely to die of heart attacks than whites, and 11 times more likely than blacks to die of the same cause. He also concluded that lesbians are 487 times more likely to die of murder, suicide, or accidents than straight women. \r\nRemarkably, these claims have become staples of the anti-gay right and have frequently made their way into far more mainstream venues. For example, William Bennett, education secretary under President Reagan, used Cameron's statistics in a 1997 interview he gave to ABC News' "This Week." \r\nHowever, like virtually all of his "research," Cameron's methodology is egregiously flawed — most obviously because the sample he selected (the data from the obits) was not remotely statistically representative of the LGBT population as a whole. Even Nicholas Eberstadt, a demographer at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, has called Cameron's methods "just ridiculous

Provide ONE source from a legitimate MEDICAL journal. You are a very sick person. 3 to 1 odds: suicide by the end of the year, anybody want that action?

MYTH # 8\r\n Gay people are more prone to be mentally ill and to abuse drugs and alcohol. \r\nTHE ARGUMENT\r\n Anti-gay groups want not only to depict sexual orientation as something that can be changed but also to show that heterosexuality is the most desirable "choice" — even if religious arguments are set aside. The most frequently used secular argument made by anti-gay groups in that regard is that homosexuality is inherently unhealthy, both mentally and physically. As a result, most anti-gay rights groups reject the 1973 decision by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to remove homosexuality from its list of mental illnesses. Some of these groups, including the particularly hard-line , claim that "homosexual activists" managed to infiltrate the APA in order to sway its decision. \r\nTHE FACTS\r\n All major professional mental health organizations are on record as stating that homosexuality is not a mental disorder. \r\nIt is true that LGBT people suffer higher rates of anxiety, depression, and depression-related illnesses and behaviors like alcohol and drug abuse than the general population. But studies done during the past 15 years have determined that it is the stress of being a member of a minority group in an often-hostile society — and not LGBT identity itself — that accounts for the higher levels of mental illness and drug use. \r\nRichard J. Wolitski, an expert on minority status and public health issues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, put it like this in 2008: "Economic disadvantage, stigma, and discrimination ... increase stress and diminish the ability of individuals [in minority groups] to cope with stress, which in turn contribute to poor physical and mental health."

Yes it was a hate crime. Anytime someone does something as heinous as that it's a hate crime. A crime is a crime. If those guys get caught I hope they get theirs
