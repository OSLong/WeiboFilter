He is homophobic,  do I take it back he is differphobic.  Poeple who fear things that are different.  That is why he hates Gays.  I mean if he is okay with all the judgment and the killign of people in the bible.  \r\n \r\n \r\nAnd to quote a wise man\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nIf a fetus is a human being, how come the census doesn't count them? If a fetus is a human being, how come when there's a miscarriage they don't have a funeral? If a fetus is a human being, how come people say "We have two children and one on the way" instead of saying "We have three children?" People say life begins at conception. I say life began about a billion years ago and it's a continuous process. Continuous, just keeps rolling along.

So you bring this crazy guy on to shut him down.  What did CNN think he was going to act like?  They know better.  Sounds like a political scripted event.  Bring the lunatic fringe (BTW - both parties him them) element in and suggest they espouse the vaslues and beliefs of all in their party.  Finally, some transparency!  You know in the last weeks of October the tiny amount of decorum will be thrown to the wind.  I's say we're about a week away from candidates being linked to liquor store roberies and murder.  Wait, strike that, we covered murder already.  Expect tons of this "in the tank" BS, especially from CNN and MSNBC.  \r\n \r\nWake up America, you are being had!

Obey, correct, but that growth rate was not linear, the majority of it occurred before 2000, since then, the market has been very risky and not all that productive (some articles have called the 2001-2010 period the lost decade), and that raises the issue whether is makes sense for retirement funds to be placed there. We are not doing business in the same environment that we were 1980 to 1999, and just how trustworthy is Wall Street these days?.

To A Patriot From Auburn:  I am not a Bible Scholar but I am a Believer.  And, it may be as you stated.  I do believe the Bible says something like "a day is like a 1000 years and a 1000 years is like a day with God" or something along those lines.  Whatever the time frame, I think God created Heaven and Earth as well as all living things.  So, the old question, "which came first, the chicken or the egg?" is an easy one for me.  God created teh chicken.  Then the chicken laid the egg.  Simple!\r\n \r\nThanks for your apparent agreement on the elecion issue. I asked a local legislator recently a state government question.  He put the blame on the federal government saying they had to abide by federal regualations.  I am sure that is true, but I had to ask him what good state government is.  Of course, we need it! They need a full time salary for a part time job!!! If you are registered in or near Auburn, you may want to pick up a sample ballot before the election.  You can get those at your probage Judge's office or they can tell you where to pick one up.  There are several admendmenst on the ballot.  Read admendment nuber 8 carefully. It deals with legislator's salary!  When legislators vote themselves a 'median HOUSEHOLD income" for a partime job, it is time to vote against every one.  They will get a full time salary for 3 months work.  And, it isn't even based on an "individual's average income" but on a "household average income!"  Tell me that is not a rip0off!!!

"Another aspect of the biblical case for marriage that Mr. Vines does not address is the teaching of Jesus regarding marriage," Lenow observed.\r\n"In Matthew 19:3-12, Jesus is confronted by the Pharisees about marriage. While their question addresses the issue of divorce, Jesus answers them with his interpretation of God's design for marriage – one man and one woman for life," said Lenow.\r\n"In verses 4-6, Jesus responds, 'Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.' In this passage, Jesus affirms that God created male and female and that marriage is designed between one man and one woman ... Biblical marriage and biblical sexuality is heterosexual in nature according to Jesus himself." Read more at

He wasn't interupting , he was answering the question and she began to talk over him first, he just kept going because he was ready for her to try and cut him off. She got frustrated because she couldn't control the interview as it seemed she brought him on to try and make him look bad and couldn't. She was very condescending with the , "This is Hate Speech isn't it?  If she wouldn't have been showing or implying a usually patronizing descent from dignity or superiority he wouldn't have had to keep talking to try and get his point in. By the way I don't necessarily agree with him, its just that I think she had an agenda to put him down and failed, so she ended the interview.

Heart disease, cancer obesity and  substance abuse have killed hundreds of millions more people, due their particular "life style".  Should we NOT support them, either?   Pick and choose the people you "love" to hate.  By your tone,, God must be a hateful and bitter god.  Or, is God pure love?  I choose the latter.

I can agree with so of what you say...Its true that the 1% blame all the 47 % for the crash of the housing market Most people that lost their homes lost it due to losing a job , where did the Jobs go to China for wages that pay one dollar a  hr...These Corps suck our jobs out of country and then they bring back the Sh*t , back here for us to buy....The Corps are getting welfare while the middle class is going south to the poor house.. God help us all if the the Republicans get in..It will be the 1 % living in like Gods and 80 % bowing down to them...Oh yes you need 19 % to back an army ( Police State ) to keep us like Sheep..

Bryan Fischer is only interested in his "15 minutes of fame" . Hitler is a part of history that needs to be forgotten, and comparing the homosexual population, in any way, to him makes me shudder at the thought. In no way do I think that Mr. Fischer should have been invited to the show, and shame on CNN for having him knowing what he stands for.

To someone (John Johnson);  I wasn't there but I don't have to be there. My comments are based on my faith and what I think the Bible says.  I accept the Bible over the idle words of anyone here on Earth today.  If you disagree with my comments that there may have been a Big Bang or that God created the Heavens and the Earth, then I ask you the same questions you asked me.  "How do you know?" " Were you there?"  You don't have to answer. I know you weren't there!!!!

Expulsion. Arrest, castration by physical means, and some time in a nice small isolated cell with a man named Bubba.\r\n \r\nGods, this bastard is sick to even joke about this kind of stuff. If it is a joke. I hope it was meant to be funny. \r\n \r\nIf not. Ladies (and gentlemen) at that school, please travel with a buddy or more everywhere, even to the bathroom. Lock your dorm rooms, buy a deadbolt lock for your dorm room doors. Make sure the regular lock is always locked when alone. Secure your windows. Carry some sort of weapon on your person at all times. Same with your phones.\r\n \r\nPay attention to your surroundings and instincts. If someone is giving you a bad vibe, please report them ASAP. Hell, get a chastity belt! Just make sure you cannot be taken advantage of.

Well, I have known a handful of artistic types in my life, and they all had emotional issues and odd quirks. One that I know currently has terrible trouble with nightmares, and he can only handle being around people in small doses( I understand this)  He has to take a break and go off alone. WHY these people attach themselves to ME I have no idea, but that's often the case.

IF NOT YOU REALLY SHOULD. YOU WILL NEVER HEAL FROM THE DEEP EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL SCARS HE LEFT ON YOUR A$$ IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT THE FACTS AND FORGIVE HIM. BE A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND FORGIVE HIM AND YOURSELF. REMEMBER IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT AT ALL. SOME PEOPLE JUST LIKE IT AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. WE ALL KNOW YOUR GUILTY FEELINGS ARE THE MOTIVATION BEHIND YOUR POSTS AND THAT WHENEVER THAT IS POINTED OUT YOU CHANGE YOUR SCREEN NAME AND TRY TO HIDE FROM THE TRUTH, BUT THE TRUTH IS IN YOU JUST LIKE THE PRIEST WAS AND YOU CAN NEVER RUN AWAY FROM THAT FACT. SO PLEASE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE BE THE GOOD CHRISTIAN YOU SAY YOU ARE AND GO SEE THE PRIEST AND FORGIVE HIM. LET HIM SHOW YOU THE LOVE OF CHRIST (AGAIN) AND TEACH YOU HOW TO FORGIVE YOUR SELF.

Tom Cruise is just as screwed up as the rest of Hollywood, but even though his personal life is a complete train wreck, there is no denying that Tom Cruise is a fantastic actor!  He is like Michael Jackson, that guy could sing better than anybody, but his personal life was a giant train wreck also, even worse than Tom Cruise, and that is saying something.

according to the bible no sin is above any other so excessive drinking, wearing clothes of different materials, tattoos, jealousy, laziness, greed, murder, being gay, and sex for not for procreation's purpose are all equal in the eyes of God. So shut your heathen sinning self up. So long as you have sinned in any manner you area sinner regardless of the sin. And all men are born with sin. You're just as much of a horrendous abomination of sin as ever gay man, murder, rapist, and thief there ever was. You no doubt have worn clothes of two different materials and that sin is just as destructive as homosexual pedophilia and rape and murder. You best repent or you might end up spending an eternity with a gay man...

Many atheists make fun of the Bible saying that it is complete impossible  that God always has and always will exist, and then they discover that Steven Hawkin proves what the Christians have said about God being the Alpha and the Omega is fully supported by scientific fact....go figure.  So I find it comical that Stephen Hawkin actually proves something that he is trying in vain to disprove, HOW IRONIC IS THAT!  \r\n\r\np.s.

What Jasmin said is not true about homosexuality but this is............\r\nThe list of diseases found with extraordinary frequency among male homosexual practitioners as a result of **** intercourse is alarming: \r\n**** Cancer \r\nChlamydia trachomatis \r\nCryptosporidium \r\nGiardia lamblia \r\nHerpes simplex virus \r\nHuman immunodeficiency virus \r\nHuman papilloma virus \r\nIsospora belli \r\nMicrosporidia \r\nGonorrhea \r\nViral hepatitis types B & C \r\nSyphilis25 Sexual transmission of some of these diseases is so rare in the exclusively heterosexual population as to be virtually unknown. Others, while found among heterosexual and homosexual practitioners, are clearly predominated by those involved in homosexual activity.

Sounds like CNN was instigating another publicity stunt... mission accomplished, Carol!  You got your moment in the spotlight...  too bad you had to stoop so low to do it.

We as grass roots hard line poor/middle class Americans  have allowed the Goverment to RULE us. \r\nBecause of so much lame apathy through the past 40 years, the changes in SS management has lost what FDR originated this program for. No it is not an Entitlement. Its hard earned income and was never meant to be TAXED while recieving it. Greedy Educated CROOKS run this country and until we gather together, unite and march on washington, the worst is yet to come.

That would actually be a result of spell check correcting "Pacific" to "specific" when I erred by one letter, but thank you for the immature comment and thumbs down over a simple mistake.

Great idea on that old farts part. Let's kill the baby with alcohol poisoning. I mean it's main stream  thinking now a days that' it's ok to kill a baby and toss it in to a trash can. Good for you who post on behalf of the old pricks side. This is why baby killers go free during jury trials. This is child abuse. And opinions are like a$$ holes, everybody has one.

I think MSN saw an opportunity to try and make Ryan out to be a fool after MSN's back-up boy Biden f*cked up his vp debate worse than MSN's boy Obama f*cked up his presidential debate.\r\nI think MSN tries to create controversy and take focus off of their liberal buddies everytime their liberal buddies get their a**es handed to them.

This story isn't even a story, it's a joke, how pathetic is MSN getting when they have to reach this far to try and create a lame story that tries to promote the immoral, evil, and destructive sin of homosexuality!!!!\r\n\r\nYou have to know that political correctness has completely run amok in this country when people are denied their religious beliefs and they are trying to force people to accept the immoral, evil, and destructive sin of homosexuality!  Next the political correct folks are going to try to force us to accept bestiality, incest, and pedophilia, and homosexuality as being normal, instead of the evil and destructive and immoral sins that they are.  If you are a real Christian then you listen to God, you know the difference between right and wrong, and when they are trying to force sin and immorality upon you and your family you can tell them TO STICK IT WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE!
