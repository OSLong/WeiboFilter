Just because something can never fully be stopped doesn't mean it should be legal.  There will always be rape, murder, arson, etc.  Doesn't mean all those things should be legalized too!

Yes. Absolutely.  Prostitution will never go away, and legalizing it will make it safer for both the prostitutes and their customers.  It can be regulated and taxed, which helps the economy.  There can be health regulation too, with regular checkups required.  Refusing to legalize the "world's oldest profession" is a head-in-the-sand approach.

Crying, this is about taking the guns out of violent gangs hands by dismantling their ability to make money. This is about putting women in a defensible position and about being able to track stds like never before. This is about decreasing the allure of prostitution by removing it from the list of forbidden fruits, and this is about the government making money off stupidity and infidelity. There are 0 downsides. Just look at Denmark, 40% decrease in VIOLENT street crime, not just the loss of prostitution, which wasn't a violent crime, in a short 10 years. Can you really counter argue that with anything other than "morals?"

Well, unfortunately, most kids today have to travel to places like these in order to learn about U.S. History since most of what they learn in school are lies.  Lies about our U.S. Constitution, Civil War, how God (Yeshua) played more than important roles in establishing our freedom of inalienable rights, which were given by Him.\r\n \r\nInstead, kids are forced by sick man made laws to learn about alternative life styles and crap that will never enrich your life or get you a job.

I don't think the person needs to be killed but he needs more than a weekend in jail. Maybe 2 fingers of his or her choosing. Chopping block and hatchet, no anesthesia. I beleive that a couple of punishments will turn the tide against this type of crime.

I am sure they just threw them away after the big art show,  they think oh well we can get more for the next project!     He takes how does he replace???

I think any American that buys one of these cars are traitors. Until we can get Americans working at American companies again, we should purchase American made goods. As long as we let foreign companies push their JUNK here we are going to be at their mercy. Before you buy any more of their JUNK, stop and think "Do I really need that," and if you can get by without it, bank the money you would have spent and look for an American product. It will probably be better built and only slightly more expensive.

Are you really going to stop dead on the freeway to try and save it off your glass? Will you give that cockroach mouth to mouth?\r\nenuf said.

Peter, we're not arguing the age gap. we are arguing getting that drug money out of gang members hands! We are talking about dignifying the profession and making it safe! And no, it removes credibility from the gangs. forbidden fruit is a lot less attractive when it's no longer forbidden. And we are talking about bouncer-defended, indoor institutions where anyone who checks in can be contacted if an employee comes up with an std. It's the ultimate safeguard you ignoramous. No argument apart from relativity of morals can even be brought against legalization, regulation, and taxation of prostitution.

I would tell her she needs to stop the next short bus and beg the driver to take her to a real school. But it's most likely too late, her retarded parents are probably brother and sister, and she's a retard as well.  I hope for her sake there is public assistance in New Zealand because she will never be a normal functioning member of society. Her best bet would be to hook up with a polygamist Mormon family and be the lowest ranking brood mare of the stable.

Oh, Ms. Nguyen, couples had better talk about sex!  People want to act like it will just flow with all the love.  No, it won't.  Women are programmed way different and the modern lifestyle and the two wage earner household has wrought havoc on the matter of intimacy.  Women are taking on more than they did decades ago, and are tired and far more independent, a lot less accomodating.  This should be discussed, the frequency, the variety, the level of desire, etc.  Most men are starving in this department and feel guilty even desiring their wives who see sex as just another demand on thier time and energy.  Men are forced to turn to other means of 'closeness' and or intimacy which brings its own dangers into a marriage or they become depressed feeling unwanted and guitly for even having the desire.  This is so important and should not be overlooked.  This man and most of his buddies can attest to this.  It is parodied on t.v. and in movies, but it is real and important.  Why do you think the pornography industry thrives the way it does.  Talk, sex and be clear and honest, but let the demonstration do most of the talking which to some is a moral issue, but it should not be skipped or taken for granted.

"Get any"? Get any what? This is an example of why it is dehumanizing. You are making the point of using a woman for her "parts". How do you not see the degradation in that? Do you really believe most of these women choose this occupation because it's what they dreamed of becoming when they were little girls? And yes, they were "little girls" at one time and could very well  have been your little girls. Does that make any difference to you? Being your sister, your niece, your grand-daughter? Most prostitutes are streetwalkers - they are not escorts or high-priced call girls. Most enter into prostitution because they were sexually/physically abused as a child. Does this make you feel "like a man" to use one of these women knowing that many have little choice when they sell themselves? Or are you so desperate that you don't even care?

We watch them come & go. I talked to an old man in his eighties. He said it was easy. He sold his home, cars, furniture and hit he road with his wife. You bill everything to your credit card. Pay it off every month. Pull a little vehicle behind. Travel the north in the summer and head south in the winter. His wife died after 12 years but he continues on fishing. Senior park passes discount a lot of money in overnight fees. A week or two in each place and a planned route. He said he always had a million dollar view.

Tabby...awesome story. Whoever decided to take care of these "ducks" should face animal cruelty charges but my guess is, if caught, they will not be held accountable because the town wanted the animals removed. Where I live a Wildlife Officer was shot and killed after stopping a person suspected of poaching deer. In an ironic twist, the park service later decided to dispose of the same deer population on the same day the alleged killer's court appearance made the front page. Rather ironic and a total oversight to report them inches apart if you ask me.

No.  This was no joke.  It is akin (no pun intended against Akin) to the racist "jokes" that people tell and then say theymeant nothing by them.  This was a reflection on what people actually believe.  Once they are found out, they should be expelled.  Period.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  No parental excuses about "boys will be boys."  These people are rapists.  Would you want your daughter to be the victim of something like this?

it is such a shame that this little boy had his friends killed, and hopefully the person or persons who did this will realize how they hurt an innocent child. That may never happen as there are a lot of just mean people who feel it is their right to do whatever they wish to do, no matter the consequences to the innocent. As for the parents, they need to go to the city officials and ask for their understanding and if they can get replacement animals. Some towns are allowing poultry as people have come to rely on the fresh eggs coming from a known source. In this case a possible case could be made that the child could be allowed replacement poultry given his needs as an autistic child. It would be very hard for the parents to explain to any child such a senseless act, and given his special needs just about impossible. It is up to the parents to do what they must with the help of people who understand the needs of this child. If the parents get the okay to get poultry again they must do everything possible to insure the chickens etc are females, no crowing roosters, and that they keep the pens clean and away from neighboring homes. A huge concern of city officials are the noise and smell of chickens that are not kept in clean pens and are allowed to fly, which can be curtailed with wing clipping. I do hope there can be a good solution, but wonder if it wouldn't be better to look into a therapy dog, which seems like a better choice than poultry, which no matter how clean, can carry diseases. just a thought.

People that have a strong faith tend to be happier and they tend to remain married longer, not sure that is a political statement.  However, polls have shown that Democrats tend to consider themselves Spiritual, but are less tied to a certain denomination and there are more athiests and agnostics among Democrats.  This would tend to suggest that for Democrats religion is of less importance than it is for Republicans.  Furthermore, a previous entry stated that Democrats are better educated.  Actually, educators tend to be Democrats, but Republicans tend to be better educated in the general populace.

What Romney is proposing sounds very similar to Reagan's " trickle down economics " where you give the break at the top and magically the middle class benefits with more job creation. Unfortunately, the rich just kept the extra savings. This policy did not work for Reagan and it won't work for Romney.\r\nI'll stand with Big Bird!

I recall how the VW Beetle initially turned the American car industry on its head. When folks were saying the same kind of things - oh it's junk, no one will buy it, etc - young people and people on limited budgets went out and bought them in droves. Why? Because they were a sturdy but basic cars and they were affordable. Soon, it became not only normal, but "cool" to own one. I would not go out now and buy a car for over $25K, which is what current new compact cars now cost. However, I WOULD go and buy a reliable car for local transportation for under $10K. I think a LOT of students who need transportation and have $40K in student loans will buy them as well. As with the original Beetles, the only market resistance is that they ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  Import them and we will buy them!  Let the snobs fork out a small home mortgage for a car. Give us inexpensive basic transport. Remember that even those $25-35K models are being recalled, so don;t tell me BS about "quality."

Tata Motors.\r\n  What will the Oil Companies do to stop it?\r\n It is an auto engine that runs on air. That's right; air not gas or diesel or electric but just the air around ... us. Take a look.\r\n Tata Motors of India has scheduled the Air Car to hit Indian streets by August 2012\r\n The Air Car, developed by ex-Formula One engineer Guy N. For Luxembourg-based MDI, uses compressed air to pu**** engine's pistons and make the car go.\r\n The Air Car, called the "Mini CAT" could cost around 365,757 rupees in India or $8,177 US.\r\n The Mini CAT which is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis, a body of fiberglass that is glued not welded and powered by compressed air. A Microprocessor is used to control all electrical functions of the car. One tiny radio transmitter sends instructions to the lights, turn signals and every other electrical device on the car. Which are not many.\r\n The temperature of the clean air expelled by the exhaust pipe is between 0-15 degrees below zero, which makes it suitable for use by the internal air conditioning system with no need for gases or loss of power.\r\n There are no keys, just an access card which can be read by the car from your pocket. According to the designers, it costs less than 50 rupees (approx. $1.12 US) per 100 KM, that's about a tenth the cost of a car running on gas. It's mileage is about double that of the most advanced electric car, a factor which makes it a perfect choice for city motorists. The car has a top speed of 105 KM per hour or 60 mph and would have a range of around 300 km or 185 miles between refuels. Refilling the car will take place at adapted gas stations with special air compressors. A fill up will only take two to three minutes and costs approximately 100 rupees and the car will be ready to go another 300 kilometers.\r\n This car can also be filled at home with it's on board compressor. It will take 3-4 hours to refill the tank, but it can be done while you sleep. \r\n Because there is no combustion engine, changing the 1 liter of vegetable oil is only necessary every 50,000 KM or 30,000 miles. Due to its simplicity, there is very little maintenance to be done on this car.\r\n This Air Car almost sounds too good to be true. We'll see in August. 2012

Isn't prostitution already legal in Vegas?  Tax it like any other service, implement health inspections, and it becomes a winning situation for all concerned. Here are just some of the immediate benefits to legalized prostitution:  Better control of STDs (savings is less hospital space being used for treatment), keeping that many out of our overwhelmed jails and prisons (very costly), putting some (not all) pimps out of business, and the government makes money.  maybe it won't yield a profit, but the money generated could be used for other purposes.\r\n \r\nIt won't eradicate the illegal side completely, but it could make a big difference.  Prostitution, legal or not, will never just go away, so instead of our government only spending money on trying to arrest, prosecute, and punish, at the very least the savings will be from not using other government resources.

You dimwits for Obama. Every tax ever passed gets paid by people buying. It doesn't matter if you make ten dollars or ten million. Businesses past the cost to the consumer. The Fed govt already taxes gas at 40 cents per gallon, if you raise taxes on gas it shows up in gas and everything else that requires gas to transport. Now lets also force interest rates near zero... this steals money from the seniors that have saved and invested for their future and only helps those who are in debt or want to borrow... Lets print more money. More money devalues money and causes the price of goods to go up, it's called inflation. Sorry, the govt does nothing to help people it only rewards the stupid and lazy. Nothing forces personal responsibility and change like pain. It's not pleasing to say but true. Without hard work and sacrifice there is no appreciation for what one has...

I think so. Then, it could be regulated and taxed!! They could make them have licences that require testing every 3 months.  There's always been this kind of business and if its legalized, it would take a lot of the danger out of it for those who are going to do it anyway. Oh, and I didn't bother to read the article.

Geez, talk about clueless.  Think about it, people, this is obviously intended as a "watch-list" for girls, so they can avoid situations that put them at risk of rape.  It is saying, in effect, don't walk alone, don't leave your windows open, don't take a drink from a guy you just turned down for sex, etc.  It isn't a joke and it isn't a guide for rapists.  It is intended to help the girls put themselves in the mind and perspective of a rapist, so they can see that a situation that seems innocent and normal to them might actually be putting them at risk for being raped.  The part about doing lots of rapes to get better at it seems gratuitous, but it may be intended to convey the message that if a guy has a reputation for "not taking no for an answer" then you should probably not go to his room alone with him.  One would assume that would be automatic, but kids sometimes don't think the way adults do, so maybe you can't be too careful even with warning about the most obvious risk factors.

"If ever the U.S. were to rethink prostitution laws and regulations, they might look something like the law Sweden enacted in 1999. The Kvinnofrid law made it legal to sell sex but not to buy it. That is, prostitutes couldn’t be charged with a crime but their clients would be charged, as would traffickers, pimps and brothel operators. "\r\n \r\nWhat the heck sense does this idiotic law make? So now we're writing inequitable treatment into law (i.e. only the jons get prosecuted?)? Is that what the feminazis and liberal wussy boys' idea of progress is?

I think it's pretty obvious and not an oversight that he didn't bronze his face on purpose. You can see a distinct and perfect line at his neck line.

It is not legal within Vegas city limits, but it is legal in some counties in Nevada.

No, we are saying tax immoral behavior, dimwit. If you want to pay to get laid, then why not remove some power from street gangs while we're at it? There are no downsides if you actually take 5 minutes to examine the entire scope of the issue.

Absolutely yes.  It's naive to think that men should be able to suppress their desires if they are unable to attract a woman.  Better to have them pay for the services of a willing professional who is routinely regulated by the state than to commit some sick sex crime with an innocent woman or child.\r\n \r\nStreetwalkers, pimps, addicts, runaways, and predators now service this market, leading to addtional crimes, and the spreading of diseases.  Plus, they tie up the courts, the police and the jails.\r\n \r\nControled prostitution, along with SEVERE penalties for pimps, etc.\r\n \r\nWe need to get smart about this.

GM, ford and other american cars really did well in last 4 years in terms of improvement in quality and mileage. it was really bad before, but now even americans compare to japanese cars and mileage. \r\nNot only thats good for Detroit but also for all americans.  \r\nOnce americans put their brain behind R & D , no one it he world can match it.   \r\n  \r\nNot to make it political - but i m glad american car industry is well and alive. Some of the new american cars are so awesome.

MJ It's Karma. It's the law of the universe. No one can get away with the kind of crap O' has forever. Every time in American history our enemies foreign and domestic have underestimated the American people. WE are special, that's why they want to take us down SO bad.

Well actually, you are very close.  There is no such thing as the 'love' they portray in Hollywood and in the music videos.\r\n\r\nLove is actually defined as, "The intentional and freely given act of working toward the well being of another."\r\n\r\nBasically, it is a decision.  One interesting biblical quote states, "Love your spouse."  In other words, it is a command that can be acted upon.  Something that you can be advised to do, and then decide to do.\r\n\r\nThose that say, "I want a divorce because I don't love him anymore" have no idea what love is.

I agree with your thought but someone already killed the others and they were fighting city/town officials to keep the animals. In other words, getting more may bring the same result. Rather stupid for the city to complain though, unless they were keeping a rooster or somehow the chickens wandered free. If I were the parents, I'd look into getting the kid something he could keep as a traditional pet. It is possible it would not have the same effect, but you can interact with a dog way more than you can a chicken. People really are the worst creatures on this planet.
