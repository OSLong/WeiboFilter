Paranormal 4 surprises me that it is scoring so low in revenue.  It is, by far, the scariest of the Paranormal movies but out to date.  Just because it's a 4th in a series of movies, do not let that discourage you from seeing it.  I have never seen an entire theater scream in such unison, as well as that often, and I watch only scary movies in theater :)

It wasn't necessarily about seeing the same plot as a way to get some answers to what happened to two of the characters.  Does not make me an idiot to go see the 4th in a series, there are many more forms of entertainment out there that are an indication of low intelligence.  But, I would agree that intelligence level of nation is lowering.  Entertainment is NOT the cause though - lazy, lousy parenting and lack of secondary education are the cause.

It's all about control, who's beliefs and values are going to set the president for everyone else. Does anybody realize, that an overwhelming number of people don't put much credence in the bible. Especially about how some people think it applies to issues in modern times, live and let live. A lot of people hold being secular in high regard on social and a host of other issues, without biblical / scripture  consideration, that's called moving forward in the 21st century.

If Romney wins, it just means you'll get more welfare checks called "tax cuts" that your kids will have to pay for. If you want more money, why don't you work for it instead of getting tax cuts from Uncle Sam? It's called the "work ethic" and conservatives preach it to the handicapped but don't practice it themselves. I had a stroke in college over 30 years ago, then went back & got a masters in math. Then the private sector wouldn't hire a cripple, so I worked 22 years as a computer programmer for the Air Force. The person you treated like garbage helped keep you free; but I never touched your blood money tax cuts, I've seen too many friends die for your greed.

Think about the last few Presidents..\r\nWhat did they do after they left office?\r\nAside from Bush Sr., who was convinced by Bill Clinton to occasionally work for his foundation, and Bush Jr. occasionally shows up to help at Barack Obama's behest-in between puppy portraits...What was they're contribution to society in their post presidency?\r\nWe all know that both Clinton ( The William J. Clinton Foundation) and Carter (Habitat for Humanity) worked tirelessly to better the lives of others...You don't really hear about them relaxing on the ranch, having tea socials or shyt like that... \r\nThat should tell you the difference between democrats and republicans, right there.

Stop welfare benefits to everyone.   Build orphanages for neglected children.  Staff those orphanages with healthy people who will not prey on the children.  Arrest and jail the wealthy predators (you know who you are. You live in the wealthy 'burbs.  You supply  illegal drugs and pollute the environment which keeps the people in a state of chaos.    Then have the population collectively pray, fast and repent.   Repeat the cycle as often as needed.

Idiots...what are you dumb, blind, can't see?\r\n \r\nThe claim to fame for most blacks are sports or rapping.\r\n \r\nYou people see what alienation does to a people as fact, the proof in the pudding lies in Detroit (and other high black populated areas), yet you sit in your comfy couches and play blind, read articles like this, judge, self-hate for your own ineffectiveness and then hate others, for our ineffective local or national goverments. Blame Obama, ok! That sounds good? In Obama's defense, he could blame the last Republican President. Blame Bush. If a black man doesn't win the next presidentail election we will no doubt blame Romney. Democracy means the people govern with the right to vote, or by other means(shhhhhh). So, blame the people. I blame the people...personally I blame everyone...white and black or other...\r\n \r\nFor being idiots...\r\n \r\nStuck on Race...\r\n \r\nPrimitive Monkeys...\r\n \r\nAnd Bigots...

I will tell you a true story involving a 1 day inpatient operation I had on my nose. Mostly straighting my septum. I was in the 1 day area for about 5 hr. I was put under and my nose was rotoruttered. I came to in recovery, was taken back to my room until I got my witts back and all was stable. My wife took me home. \r\nThe bill came and 50,000.00 was billed to my insurance. I only recieved a printed overall amount and what I owed. I owed 250.00. I have no complaints about that. But I went to the hospital for a total print out to see what on earth cost 50K about this. I got my print out and after I pushed with a few questions I was told my insurance would only pay 10k and that is what the hospital agreed to charge the insurance co. The rest they write off. It's all a tax deduction scam to work in a margin on their tax return.  \r\nThis way they can say to their employees we can not give you a raise we are not making money. Then at tax time the show a big loss and get a return based on this for their profit.  A SCAM!

I am really amazed and dismayed that the fact that Romney has diametrically changed stances between the primaries and the main election is disregarded by those who think he is the better candidate now. I really do not know what his stance on many of the issues are because he has shifted to a completely opposite stance. If he indeed is doing this now to get the moderates to vote for him it is cynical game playing. How can you trust this person? The Republican party will hold his feet to the fire if he takes these liberal stances if he becomes the President. That is where his true allegiance lies, regardless of what he himself believes and regardless of what he says now. This person does not deserve to be the President. He is doing exactly what a businessman would do - he is selling something, not for the benefit of the common folks, but for his own. That is the most unscrupulous behavior a person can demonstrate.

Cheryl Cole is a great singer and has a great voice. She's an amazing person and I think if she did come to America, Americans would fall in love with her. She's a good role model as well.

@Walrus12 So you think no one should have the right to tell women what to do with their bodies. If that's so then no one should have the right to decided if the baby can should live or not. The baby has a body too, and if it were old enough wouldn't want somebody saying they shouldn't live. So selfish!

Definitely; we have a right to our thoughts and opinions.  Yours differs from mine.  The best I can say to you is this, whatever your thoughts and opinions, we all have them, and I in no way asked to be attacked by providing my own thoughts and opinions on the subject.  I love *all* people, and I have no problem with people making their own choices in this life; that is not mine to choose.  But when all of us do pass away, my own personal opinion is that I would rather choose to follow the Word of God and take that chance that He may be a "myth" than be on the other side of eternity without Him.  This is not the debate, Adamus.  There is no "debate," in fact; *this* was **my own opinion**, and I did not seek nor need anyone's approval.

December 21, 2012 is just the end of a long cycle, then a new long cycle begins. With every ending comes a new beginning. \r\n The "end time" is the 12th age of a 12 age cycle, we are currently living in the "end time". Soon a new 12 age cycle will begin. The 1st age of the next 12 age cycle is called the "first time", a "new beginning". \r\n Some schools of thought consider the age of Aquarius as the 1st age of the 12 age cycle, some consider the age of Leo as the 1st age of the 12 age cycle. The 7th age is the "age of reason"! We are at the dawn of either the "glorious first time" or the "age of reason"! \r\n On earth, as it is in heaven. AMEN!

Whether you believe it is a myth or not, the One Who created the universe still exists.  Belief or disbelief in the Creator does not change it.  \r\n\r\nThen I saw all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, he cannot find it out. - King Solomon, in Ecclesiastes\r\n\r\nYou live your life the way you want; that is fine.  These--yours included--are our opinions, and if you cannot stand to be on the same web page as others who can speak civilly and express opinions without hurling stones and unkind words, then don't participate.  I respect ideas and opinions, until they become words that go past opinions and begin to belittle others.

#Rhet15, Funny you should mention Coleman Yooung. He would have never gotten elected if it wasn't for the fact that the Detroit Police had a bad but proven habit of kicking Blacks butts on a daily basis and running back to their suburbs each night to brag about their exploits. I don't make any excuse of anyone Black or White who don't take care of their belongins or take pride in thier surroundings. But I do take exception with all this anti-black hate that is pouring out on these pages! If you think that all Black people are lazy and on welfare, you're seriously mistaken. Most welfare recepients are white, but that's not well publicized. It's easier to blame those you HATE. Detroit is hurting for many reasons and the major one is not the color of the inhabitants. You see the real issue is funds, not the funds you give to folks, but the funds that grow businesses. If there are no jobs on industry, then the city will die and it is doing now. The businesses are all owned by the minority majority. If you don't like the way things are going, just starve the city and wait, it will soon die and you can then retrun to take over. I will agree that there is a mentality in Detroit that is deeply rooted in the 70s and it needs to change. We as Blacks now determine our own destiney and some of us are doing a piss poor job. Some of the readers here are right in saying we need to take responsibility for our own shortcomings, and we have not! But simply being Black is not the cause, but a easy target for those who need it to further their cause.

@ Q-Z-Sue: A human being is a human being whether or not he/she has taken their first breath. By aborting you are robbing the child's future..of LIFE. How can you say a baby is just an embryo..haven't you seen pictures of late abortions?? Those pictures are very clear that the baby is not just a cluster of cells but a tiny developed human being that should have the chance to live..and make their own decisions in life. Like for example the decision to live. Once a woman is pregnant their is a another human life within her whether you believe so or not. Also it shouldn't be just up to the woman to make a decision on her abortion. It takes two to procreate and the father should have some say. In the end its not just her baby its his too. A baby receives half DNA from both parents so you can't just say the baby is the woman's only and she should have all of the say.

kimberly a ....i will say thanks ..........i,m a person who still helps the poor and soup kitchens and if obama doesn,t care that is not the subject the sucbect is the kitchen is losing money and help because paul ryan is a moran cleaning clean dishes. i,m sure if you volunteered maybe you would see life anotherway wouldn,t you. its sad bush left this mess with 2 wars ortd medicare prescription on a credit card and all and mr. obama came in and mitch mcconnel says the only thing is to not pass or help us americans do antything for the last couple years . yes a mission to stall that is worse too because once again paul ryan had his dirty hands in that too. now he wants my vote well tell him to clean his hands at work before he cleans dishes that are already clean. i,m a independent and agree that if i want a republican which i have voted for in past then i would as i would for a democrat. this election i,m thinking wow i,m done thinking my mom is on oxygen 24 hrs a day. so if you want to kill my mom then vote fro romney if you want to save my mom then vote for obama. its easy just press button with his name on it and save millions of elders. that is my belief our elders are the ones who got us here and for goverment to get cadillac healthcare after 1 term is crazy dump that and if you have kids pay for them yourself for schooling as i worked all my life . well thank you so much i bet you are a wonderful person and hope god will bless you as i do but that is up to you to do as the lord says and that is help people not kill them . everyone vote for obama he is a true american who wants to give all people a go at life ..alll i say women , men and even mr outsource mitt romney and ryan. thank you

This wanna be preacher better stop his evil ways, and stop telling lies and stop trying to get people to go against what God and Jesus Christ both said about the immoral, evil, and destructive sin of homosexuality.  If not this preacher, who is doing the work of the devil, will end up in a special place in hell that God created for all those people who lie about him, and try to get people to engage in evil and sinful behavior.........\r\n\r\nWhat is the homosexual's hope?  The only hope for the homosexual, and all people who break God's laws, is to realize that God is holy and he will rightfully judge all who have sined against him by breaking his law (1 Kings 8:32; Ps. 9:8; 1 John 3:4).  If he did not do this, then he would be approving of wrong doing.  However, God is loving (1 John 4:8) patient (Rom. 2:4), wanting people to repent (Acts 17:30) and come a saving knowledge of him so they might be redeemed.  What this means is that the sinner must turn to Christ, who is God the Son in flesh (John 1:1,14; Col. 2:9), who bore our sins in his body on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24), died and rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:1-4), and made it possible for sinners to be saved from the righteous judgment of God by faith in what Jesus did on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21) and be forgiven of their sins (Eph. 2:8).  This is done receiving Christ (John 1:12), by believing in him and his sacrifice that is a payment for our sins to God the Father.  Like any sinner, the homosexual needs to repent, receive Christ by faith, and be saved from God's righteous judgment by trusting in Christ and the judgment that fell upon him on the cross.  They need to pray and ask the Lord Jesus to save them.

The politicians who got and keep Detroit where it is today should be arrested, put on trial and hung by their thumbs for a very, very long time.  Then deal with the gang problem by creating positive and achievable solutions for their hopelessness and the hopelessness felt by the entire community.  Afterall, these are people with the same hopes, dreams and aspirations as you and I, but can see no way of getting there.  Perhaps, a good start would be to put them to work by cleaning up their own communities.  Just an idea..........

Loaded question.  It can't recover.  The soul which kept it alive and thriving was the gigantic U.S. auto industry and all of the countless associated sub industries and suppliers.  Investment poured into Detroit and as a result produced great wealth and growth in population as seekers of employment from poorer states found a hot market for labor.  All of Detroit's eggs were in one huge basket, cars, and it \r\nnever considered foreign competition as a serious problem and it wasn't a problem back then. However, other countries such as Germany and Japan were beginning to develop industry and it was only a matter of time when Detroit's monopoly in the auto industry was to be seriously challenged. In the end, it was a matter of other countries' coming of age and developing their own industries which spelled doom for the big three (four if you count AMC).  Purchasers of new automobiles saw wider choices open to them and they voted with their checkbooks.  The rest is history.

I am so sorry for the pain you endured, walkingeagle.  No one ever has a right to do anything like that to anyone, for any reason.  Many of my close friends are gay.  They know what I believe, and I know what they believe, and it is not mine to judge someone's choices in this life.  Life is hard enough on this earth!  I can't fathom the ugliness of others to do these things to each other.  I love God, and I love His Word; but I will *NOT* bash others!  And when others speak badly to me because I defend God's Word, I see it as a "bashing"; and yet, I called no one any names, I spoke no ill to anyone; I love all people.  It hurts me to see others so mistreated, regardless what it is.  NO ONE deserves this kind of mistreatment.  Ever!  My heart is out to you for all you went through.  Please accept my own apology for all who can't see past their own judgmentalism.  Other people who truly love God *know* in their hearts that the Word doesn't change, but it does NOT give license to bash others!  \r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nBarbie

No.  I have two cats, they are brother and sister,  and are 15 1/2 years old.  Too old for adventures like this.  It would sure be fun, though.  This clip is a pleasure to watch.  You can tell how much they enjoy each other's company.  May they ride safely for many miles to come.

Detroit is not a Democrat or a Republican issue but is a jobless issue. Wonder why there was "white flight" from the city? Do you think it had something to do with blacks being fed up with being push aside everyday and they had enough? I don't blame whites for all of Detroits ills because tearing up your things is no excuse, but I will hold both whites and blacks responsible for holding on to old perceptions that needed to be buried. But as long as both sides keep holding onto those old perceptions, then nothing will change. Whites will always think that Blacks are just lazy and Blacks will always think that Whites owe them something. For those of you who harbor those feelings, you both are DEAD wrong.

You seem very lost and confused, maybe because you aren't  a Christian like you claim, God commands all Christians to lead their brothers and sisters away from sin, not lead them into sin like all the Gay Pedophiles constantly do all the time.\r\n\r\nIt's not rocket science if you support murder, rape, incest, pedophilia, robbery, homosexuality and all the other sins, then you are supporting sin doing the devil's work as only the devil and his minions promote sin!  As everybody knows God and his followers are against sin.  FYI Christians don't decide what is and isn't sin, God does and God clearly states that homosexuality is an immoral, evil, and especially destructive sin, and if you continue to sin, without repenting and changing your evil ways, you will burn in Hell for eternity, and this is the word of Jesus Christ and Our God!  If you doubt me look it up in The Holy Bible.

Iron sits in the blood, as if in a pocket.  If you are lacking iron, you may need to take supplements.  If you received a transfusion, what was it?  Was it full blood?  Was your hemoglobin low?  Levels should be approximately 12.  What is your ethnic background?  There is a condition wherein some people from Africa, southern mediterranean, and Asia are lacking an enzyme in the blood which causes hemolytic anemia (low blood count). It's called G6PD deficiency (glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency).  It requires transfusions.  It is an x chromosome mutation; therefore, when you obtained an x from your mother and an x from your father, even if one were bad, you can suffer from this.  There is no cure, but you would need to eliminate certain medications, alcohol and food so that your blood levels would be correct.  Have that checked.

Of course Obama would win, look who is taking the votes. My stepdaughter was told by a history teacher last year that liberals are for progress and great things and that a conservative wants nothing more than to see you die in the streets with no healthcare. Teachers today forget that they are to educate and not endoctrinate.

Macro-evolution is not a theory. Macro-evolution is not even an educated guess. In fact, it is hardly even an uneducated guess. It makes no attempt to model real-world observations, data, or information; while pure materialist try to distort data to fit a prior conclusion to make their world view  more credible. Rather, macro-evolution is a magical story to fill in the gaps of our knowledge when we were not equipped with the ability to understand. Therefore, it is in no way a viable or possible explanation since it doesn't model any data in the first place. Sure, macro-evolution can be taught in World History or some such class, but certainly not in a class that preaches it to be a viable explanation or supported conclusion. Creationism, rather, is supported by a compendium of human knowledge, experiments, gathered data, and observations. Nothing negates this theory. And, the support for Creationism is so overwhelming and conclusive that it is defined as a Scientific Theory, the highest level any body of knowledge can be promoted to. I hope that clarifies things for you, Omega. It is legal to teach macro-evolution in public schools as a viable conclusion, which nothing but magic.

You have to know that political correctness has completely run amok in this country when people are denied their religious beliefs and they are trying to force people to accept the immoral, evil, and destructive sin of homosexuality!  Next the political correct folks are going to try to force us to accept bestiality, incest, and pedophilia, and homosexuality as being normal, instead of the evil and destructive and immoral sins that they are.  If you are a real Christian then you listen to God, you know the difference between right and wrong, and when they are trying to force sin and immorality upon you and your family you can tell them TO STICK IT WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE!\r\n\r\nHAVE A NICE DAY!
