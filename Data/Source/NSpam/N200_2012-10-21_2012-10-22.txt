My lab used to "save" rocks from the water. She didn't like to swim,(I know, weird for a lab) so it was always the rocks that were fortunate enough to be in shallow water. She was quite the hero. ;)

God and His Word, The Bible, are eternal (forever).  "Obey your parents" applies then, now, and forever.  "Do not commit adultery" also eternal.\r\n \r\n"Adultery" is having sex with anyone but your opposite-sex spouse.  No live-in, no pre-marital sex, no sex with little children, no sex with animals, no sex with your same gender.  These rules were made by God Himself and until He changes them (which He won't) our duty is to obey or face His judgement.

SORRY ZELDA, SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING. YOU WERE REFERENCING THE COMPONENTS WHILE I WAS THINKING OF THE FINISHED PRODUCT. THE PROPER TERM FOR MEASURING MOST GASSES IS GENERALLY X CUBIC FEET @ Y LBS PSI WITH X & Y BEING VARIABLES. SINCE GASSES CAN BE COMPRESSED BOTH VOLUME AND PRESSURE ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT IN MEASURING THEM. FOR EXAMPLE A BICYCLE TIRE AND A CAR TIRE BOTH CONTAINING 30 LBS PSI ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF AIR IN THEM BECAUSE THE CUBIC FEET IS DIFFERENT, AND A CAR TIRE WITH 30 LBS IN IT IS GOING TO HAVE MORE AIR IN IT THAN AN IDENTICAL TIRE WITH ONLY 20 LBS PSI EVEN THOUGH THE CUBIC FEET IS IDENTICAL. HOPE THAT HELPS.

Excuse me? Slavery was mentioned in the Bible and that's what "religious" people used to justify slavery in America until it was abolished. Abraham slept with his slave, when the Heberu (Hebrews as the Egyptians called them) went in to wage war, they took slaves, it was also ok for them to have many wives and then have concubines on the side. And never in my life have I ever had any gay people flaunt themselves in front of me. Nobody has forced me to accept the fact that they deserve rights too. If they want to marry, great, as long as they can divorce too. It's THEIR choice, not mine. If 2 consenting adults want to do that, good for them.  And some black people didn't hide their race? What about some of those very light skinned musicians years ago and those who looked white enough to go to white schools in the days of segregation? Do you think that every african american looked like their brothers back in Africa?

If you actually read the article, equinimi, you'd know that nearly 25% of Americans have no discretionary income; not over half. This makes a prime example of why education is important for future generations. The rich in your town are probably rich because of their education, hard work, motivation, and perseverance.

Homosexuality is a choice born of childhood neglect or abuse, even if it was the non violent kind.  It's a lifestyle because it is an alternative choice to traditional man woman relaionships.  Heterosexuality is the norm.  God made woman to fit man, and to procreate if they so desire.  Homosexuals cannot procreate, but they can steal another persons surrogated child so they are not discriminated to do anything that heterosexuals do except marry.  Marriage for same sex couples is an oxymoron for morons.  It doesn't exist in the Constitution as a civil liberty, nor does it exist in the Bible...under the Judeo Christian values that this country was founded on...and no you cannot talk about it without mentioning the Bible because that is the thing that defines our culture. \r\n  \r\nJust because heterosexuality is not a choice it doesn't preclude that homosexuality is, heterosexuality is our biology and our genetic code.  If homosexuality was a trait at birth then it would be genetic.  There has never been found a gene for Homosexuality.  If it were genetic it would be recessive as that it is not the normal.  Therefore it would only be possible if two people with x chromosomes for gayness reproduced, a man and a woman, and since the man having only one x chromosone for being gay, would probably not be mating with a woman, or would he?  No genetic code has been found.  Therefore, it is a result of nurture, environment and choice.  Not saying that Homosexuals have not suffered making that choice, that in and of itself does not prove the suffering means it isn't a choice.  Choices are usually hard.

If they are pregnant, they must find a job and come off their dependence of welfare. \r\n Also, get rid of the illegals on the system. They did nto pay into it, so they should not have it.

The uneven part of this is the indoctrination of the schools by liberals to "control" the thoughts of children for their new socialized America. Teach your kids on your own about history and what made us the great nation everyone wanted to move to for opportunity and a better life. The Liberal schools won't! Dummy the kids down and do not let them learn capitalism. The problem has gotten even bigger with greedy big brother government on both sides of the house.

Being that I know far morepeople in the majority that actually recieve welfare than I do those in any minority grouping, then it may stand to reason, if only in my own mind, that a black president doesn't change this for minorities.  At least I wasn't led to see this over the last 4 years, nor did I want to.\r\n \r\nNow, putting my opinion to the side,it is a statistical fact that, numerically and realistically, there are more whites on welfare than blacks, more whites than Latinos, more whites than aisians...  Now what becomes a solidified truth is the fact that this has been the case under white presidents as well as the current black one. In light of that,  I am sure it will be the same regardless of who wins. There will remain those that take advantage of the system regardless of the availability of work.  \r\n \r\nAlso,  there is nothing any one of any race can do to "take their country back" because it doesnt belong to any of us.

Marfique, you got it all wrong. God did not create homosexuals. God created man in his own image and likeness. He created man for woman. Again, I stand by the principles of the word of God. Everything you said is your thinking, it is not what the word of God says. The term homosexuality is a sin as defined in the Bible and it is wrong. I said it in my post and I wll repeat again, God is a loving God and he is giving homosexuals a chance to repent and turn away from sin which is homosexuality. I will not give you what your itching ears want to hear. Sin is sin and there is no excuse or sugar coating for sin.

Well... this dialogue is doomed.  There's No point to talk about religion, or be a religious leader, if you don't think your beliefs are more than mere (old wives) tales.   Not much everlasting life apart from "whosoever believeth"  or from belief "with whole heart."  (Unless you have a cut-&-paste attitude to Gospel-Truth.)   \r\nI  mean it is written that it is Better-to-be-Cold-or  ​ -Hot, than to be luke-warm and spewed (as vomit) from the mouth of God.  BTW, picturing Adam-&-Evan hanging around the Tree is a bit of a stretch don't you think--especially when one of them biologically switch-hit so they could produce children.  Whoo-ee, talk about writing woman out of The Beginning.  I'd say get a (functional) Faith first, then preach about it.  Meanwhile I'm following Judge Deborah--check out her story--it's on re-runs somewheres.

Too many scientific sources to quote here as far as the physical differences go (one being hormonal influences in utero) ..But you are just so out-of-touch...Homos  ​ exulality is still considered to be a mental illness? You are so ignorant and uninformed. Do not say things you can not back up...You need to educate your bigoted mind. \r\n  \r\nThe American Psychological Association, the , and the  state:     \r\n  “  In 1952, when the American Psychiatric Association published its first , homosexuality was included as a disorder. Almost immediately, however, that classification began to be subjected to critical scrutiny in research funded by the . That study and subsequent research consistently failed to produce any empirical or scientific basis for regarding homosexuality as a disorder or abnormality, rather than a normal and healthy sexual orientation. As results from such research accumulated, professionals in medicine, mental health, and the behavioral and social sciences reached the conclusion that it was inaccurate to classify homosexuality as a mental disorder and that the DSM classification reflected untested assumptions based on once-prevalent social norms and clinical impressions from unrepresentative samples comprising patients seeking therapy and individuals whose conduct brought them into the criminal justice system. \r\nIn recognition of the scientific evidence, the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1973, stating that "homosexuality per se implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities." After thoroughly reviewing the scientific data, the American Psychological Association adopted the same position in 1975, and urged all mental health professionals "to take the lead in removing the stigma of mental illness that has long been associated with homosexual orientations." The National Association of Social Workers has adopted a similar policy. \r\nThus, mental health professionals and researchers have long recognized that being homosexual poses no inherent obstacle to leading a happy, healthy, and productive life, and that the vast majority of gay and lesbian people function well in the full array of social institutions and interpersonal relationships.k up with data.

I agree with the Pastor that homosexuality is Biblically not right, but what I see is that this issue has become a "BIG DISTRACTION" for most people especially Christians. You see, the homosexual issue has become the "BIG SIN" in our eyes when God sees sin as sin. The devil has the Christian world so distracted by this issue that most people are not focusing on themselves and their own sins. We have gotten into the big sin - little sin syndrome. Jesus, during his ministry on earth gave us an example as to how He looks at and deals with sin and sinners.  In John 8:1-11, the story of woman caught in adultery shows us how WE are to deal with sin – we focus on our own. It was Jesus who said, “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”  Homosexuality is not the “big” sin – it is a sin.   So is shacking-up, stealing, lying, not loving one other, disobedience to parents, drinking, smoking, and many other sins.  Homosexuality is not the sin that’s going to bring the wrath of God on our nations – it is SIN PERIOD.  Then there’s the argument – God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah because of homosexual sin - Well the flip side of that argument is – And He destroyed a whole world (all but 8 people) with a flood because of SIN.  And I quote, “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.  And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth.” Genesis 6: 5-7.  We all have our own homosexual sins – it’s just not called homosexuality.  My Bible tells me that adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”  Galatians 5:19-21. God gives every man and woman the power of choice.  Jesus loves all us sinners, but He hates the sins we all commit. We are living in the last days, but not because of homosexual sin – it’s because of all our sins.  If the God of heaven – who allows homosexuals to live and breathe everyday and not strike them down for their “BIG SIN,” as many see it and He allows us to live and breathe in our “LITTLE SINS” – keeping in mind that to God – Sin is Sin – As for me, I’m going to focus on my shortcoming and my sins and leave the homosexuals to God. He does not need my help – just for me to love all of you.

Being influenced doesn't mean being told what to think. Children hear what others including parents and other family members say about candidates and that does have an impact. The fact this poll has accurately picked the winner in every poll since 1960 indicates they typically are influenced by adults around them. Can you seriously claim that most of your classmates study the candidates positions? I know I paid little attention prior to getting to voting age.

I agree with others who have replied here as to your thoughtful reply.  But just like the minister in the video, substitute "black" for "gay" and "white" for "heterosexual"  what do you have?  Some one does not choose to be gay.  They just are.  And treating them differently in any way is discrimination.\r\n\r\nYou obviously are not filled with hate - but you do need to educate yourself further.

If you like war so damn  much, get geared up and go over to one those sandpit hellholes yourself and start killing people for no reason other than your hubris, false sense of security and your insane GOP agenda to shed some more American blood and piss away some more taxpayer's money for no apparent reason on Earth. You are seriously delusional and misinformed. Imperialist Rome went down in flames because of their territorialism and their misplaced militarism, and unfortunately we are following in ther footsteps. More insane wars are not and neverwill be the answer ...Wise Up.

Was not it said some where by some one , that I will fight to the death for your right to your opinion . Probably a military quote of some kind . I do not recall. I should but I admit age has stolen my memory . I agree in part to what you said and as I age I realize any thing that incites hate is BAD , but this subject sure does. Age kind of sets you free to just feel . I have fought about this and the whole abortion issue . I abhor the thought of abortion and will not finance it or provide transportation for it , and yet I will not vote it away . Maybe it is a woman thing I do not know. One thing I do remember and I was there , God made my brother Gay , not choice . We sibs. knew that from day one. We did not know homosexuality . We had another name for it. We called him a sissie and a sissie he was but he was born that way. And he was christened in a church and raised the same and he was a twin. He was a pain sometimes and we fought with him and each other but he the same in every other way.

Sorry, but I do not put much faith into what students, dealing with crazed, liberal teachers would put on a ballot if they could!  My daughter has had to deal with constant attempts at indoctrination by her teachers and insults and childish comments when she doesn't cow to their beliefs!  Let these kids have a little more of a life before you try to make their innocence an election ploy!  \r\n \r\nIn 2008, when my daughter was 9 years old, she was asked by her teacher who she would vote for, Obama or McCain.  My daughter, strong-willed and intelligent, and a friend, were the only ones who did not prefer Obama.  The teacher tried to change their minds, but, they were adament about their choice.  After Obama's election the class had a party, complete with cake, ice cream, and punch, but, my daughter and her friend were asked to leave the class during the party because they did not want to vote for Mr. Obama!  It took my wife all of her feminine wiles to keep my from tearing that liberal POS a new a$$hole!

The issue is not weither God made homosexuals or not. Yes, it is true that the Holy Scriptures teach against homosexualality, but the church is not suppose to run the government. Should we return to the time of the witch hunts?, when the church became so strong that it sent out it's authorities to hunt down, torcher and kill anyone who was not in compliance with the church. That is why this country has a seperation of church and state clause. Just as christians have a right to believe the way they want to; as Americans, those who choce not to believe, have that right also. If christians are extended special privleges, more or different rights than non-christains, then the constitution has been violated. We end up with a mixture of church and state.

What about my rights? I'm not gay. I choose not to agree with homosexuality. Where does that put me? Fact is I just don't see an issue. I think people just like to bitch and complain because they can. Why argue about something so trivial when our women and men are in the middle of a war on another continent. Not to mention a little debt issue we have. I don't care if your gay. So what I'm fat! Should I be recogniaed as a minority? Is it me, or should our attention be on other importent issues? Not to hurt anyone's feelings though. Really lets get past this and let gay people be recognized in something like a Union of sorts and have the same benefits as married couples. Don't call it marriage though! Cause thats not what it is. Look it up. One man, one woman! One Nation Under God! Sorry!,but it's true. Wait! no I am not!!!!! God Bless!

This pastor clearly has a mental disorder. It's called INTOLERANCE. Is he not aware that homosexuality has been around since BEFORE his sacred bible and is not going away as long as there are still human beings being born.\r\n Since when have politicians needed to follow the bible stories? I thought we had a separation of church and state since before 1800. These right wing-nuts are sad fools. What happens if you're not Christian, but rather Jewish or Hindu? Does that mean we need to be converted and baptized in the name of good government? Pure insanity! Besides, most of us Jews don't believe in conversion so I guess gay Jews are in BIG trouble!

I'll admit...I was confused about where he was going with it, but, it was a very good speech, noting how silly the thumpers are (and hateful) when it doesn't even involve them. What do these thumpers think...that a gay person will ask to marry them? They need to get over themselves. Cracking a science book, every now & then, wouldn't hurt, either. They could learn where "gayness" comes from. \r\nTo those that are not enlightened.....it comes from the womb. Yes, people, your heterosexuality, homosexuality, ect. is determined in the womb. It is NOT a "lifestyle", as some of you refer to it. Now, get over it!

Ha! You guys don't fool me. The fact that you would make those statements shows that once a woman is onto your lies, you kick her to the curb. If you didn't have anything to hide -- if you were honest and not proficient liars -- you would not have posted a comment to try to deter women from paying attention. It seems most men believe that there is absolutely nothing in the world wrong with lying -- it's as natural as breathing.

A number of  school districts have been found to allow real left political pressure and \r\npoli-guilt trips to be forced on students.  Since this rarely makes the lib-leaning media news...they're actually probably more incidents than we're aware of.  In many cases parents have gotten involved and filed suit against superintendents & their districts in opposition to the Liberal indoctrination their child was exposesd to in the classroom. \r\n  \r\nCombine that with teachers--many of whom no longer really teach, but demonstrate and \r\nstrike against the system...and yes--of course American students will fall behind and a huge percentage will fail, drop out and go on the government dole. \r\n  \r\nChicago and their recent tirade against authority is an example----VERY POOR stats in \r\ntheir education system----and most ALL are big supporters of Obama, esp. being in his \r\nhometown. Pressusre mounts against youth....gain their minds....but don't really teach them much of anything of substance....sound familiar?  Germany--late 30's.  \r\n  \r\nPressure indeed has been mounted against children of conservative parents, who also have a right to free thinking and free speech--thanks to our democracy!

Way to go kids! They might not realize it, but they're part of a system that stands to be compromised by the right, and that is education. Funny, we acknowledge the "takes money to make money" philosophy in our businesses, but not in our government. Education is a solid investment in the future work force and job availability. Yes, with student loans it creates debt initially, but the return is not only the securing and creation of higher paying jobs, but the repayment of student loans (and interest), and the subsequent tax revenue. I think the two sides differ in WHO they give the handouts to - the wealthy and big corporations or the lower and middle classes, and small businesses. Who needs the assistance more? The kids might not realize it, but they voted in favor of their own futures.

the problem with homosexuality, besids bee inmoral, Romans 1;26 , is that these groups and we got policians in washington trying to desolved merriage to give full way to the homosexual agenda, one can't teach biblical values on schools but yet cuz its illegal not allowed, but yet homosexuality its thoughtts al school teaching that a union between tow mens or two womans its okay, and that its a familly, when even nature teach us that that is wrong, never seeing a budhole having an orgasm, or babys, so what more blind a society can be, and rebelious to what God the creator have stablish, and the we ask why so many deseases, crimes and so many other things, this country was created under a biblical foundation, and we have  steared away from that, in the name of the so call frees peech, and right. the bible says clearly , the prophet Geremiah, blessed the nation whos God is Jehova, guess what this nation have kicked God out, everything, thats why we got the mess we have..its not going to get any better.

kthrall, as someone who has no issue with homosexuality, I accept and respect your views. I appreciate that although you think it is an immoral lifestyle, you can separate it from our legal rights.\r\nAs a supporter of gay rights and not a fan of religion, I also agree that Churches do not and should not have to perform rituals of marriage for homosexuals since they are private organizations. Any changes to churches must come from the churches and their followers. I can think their decision is wrong in my opinion, but that is as far as it goes.\r\nNice that we can disagree about the lifestyle, but still agree on everything else.\r\n \r\nAs for Joe2013, since you claim to know so much about Jesus, you should know that Jesus never spoke on the subject matter of homosexuality.

Sin is a choice, who we love is a choice, and doing the right or wrong thing is a choice. If the government is going to step in and place bills on the book to give certain rights to gays then they will have to be fare and give all acts of sin a right. Do the gays not realize that the reason those others are not asking for certain rights, is because they no that they are in the wrong already.\r\nGays should just accept who they are and the lifestyle they have chosen to live and be happy and not  seek the rights as a male and female partner.   The bible said plenty of same sex relationships in the old and new testament.  The New Testaments just places all the sins in the same basket and say not to do it, the Old Testaments name them all one by one.  The message is the same sin is sin no matter who does it ,and if it is not stopped the person(s) will end up in the hell firer.\r\n \r\nLike I was told a long time ago " We must all work out our own soul salvation with fear and trembling" and God will deal with us all.   Let the wheat and the tare grow up togeather and at the time of harvest God will do the separating.  \r\n \r\nAs far as our government is concern, it is to be for the people and by the people and the majority rule and clearly in this matter the government is not listing to the majority. Because we are saying no in every kind of way we can.  If they look at the history of many powerful nations immorality is what destroyed it.  Wake up America, wake up!!!!

I have stubbornly resisted those who harangue about liberalism being a form of mental illness.  Unfortunately,  the comments about St. Obama vs. the 'demonic' Romney give me second thoughts.\r\nI have never ever read such 'intelligent' stupidity in my 65 years of non-partisanship.  Clearly, Obama is not the problem; he's merely the poster child of a much more pathogenic process among some voters.

The Early Church began the task from the beginning.   Most of the Gospels were formed from earlier scripts--and the Gospel as per Luke was most probably Greek, since he was a Greek physician (apparently.)   My first (Protestant) bible was the King James Version--translation  ​  into English was at the Royal Commission of King James the second (who was, I think, Catholic.)  The various names given to the God of Abraham (and of followers of Jesus) were muddled into Jahovah, which never existed before.  But the Holy Spirit does.  I do believe in God the Father, Jesus his only-begotten Son, *and* the Holy Spirit.  I trust in their guidance and the persons who have suffered persecution and martyrdom to give me The Truth as the Word of God appears to me.  That's it.  There are tons of scholarly notes--but go to Sunday School and find out what the big Question is first.

Thanks metalhead and Zelda I have heard the same stories about bought technology. Since I'm so old..LOL...I can remember when America led the world in everything. I don't believe we have any less talent now than we did 50 or a 100 years ago. We're just demoralized and have been betrayed by our elected leaders. Without us and our system we are the world is finished. After we get that commie out of the white house we must stand up and kick some butt. God bless America.

Kids see it.  Nearly a quarter of a million students across the country cast their ballots, and the results are in: President Barack Obama walked away with a 6 percent lead over Republican candidate Mitt Romney.

When did God let you know that he hasn't changed his mind? Did he tell you during one of your bible thumping tours? You know the bible is not at all factual. It was written by a few superstitious bearded old fools from the middle east. Check them out today. They still live in the past.

I remember taking this vote in elemenary school.  Then, the encumbant President Gerald Ford and  Candidate Jimmy Carter running.  I voted for Carter as well, but then hey, I was like 7.  Had no clue as to the difference between Democrat and Republican parties. I dont think most of the Schoolastic voters know the difference today either.  With only two election periods that were a different outcome, seems pretty accurate.

Look at the pool of voters; the most un-informed.  Of course Obama is winnng.  Irony, anyone?  Sorry, trying to be objective here...trying to be objective here.... \r\n  \r\nMy daughter went to College this year...she has spent a LOT of time actually informing her fellow students about the issues, facts, etc.  She also shared that the Democratic recruiting in College is at least twice what the Republican recruiting is.  The Democrats WANT the un-informed.  Probably why most of the elderly vote Republican, because they actually know what's happening in this Country.

They need to learn about voting more than ever before so they know about those who don't care about all people and make sure they put laws in place to block all those that are less fortunate.  It all stops here and now.  I could go on and on.  Acts 6-8, lets you know that Obama is what truth is so please get off this site with all this foolish talk about him and kids and their love for him.  The ones who didn't vote for him i'm sure where??????  I bet if Romney would have been favored all this foolishness would be posted.  Bottom line:  Obama is a wonderful person and if you don't see that something is wrong with you both in the head.  Just the fact that you got on this site and said what you have let's us know that you haven't been taught right or you just decided on your own to be a fool.  Sad, Sad. Sad.  You both are some of the people that make things worst instead of better.  Obama/Biden 2012

I find it strange that gays are trying to shut down Christians for exercising their rights under freedom of religion. Christians never said that God hated gays. God loves everyone, gay or straight. He just hate the sin of homosexuality. The gays argument is with God not the Christian. I find it also strang tha gays call this a civil right. They are right in saying they have the right to do what they feel is right, but don' say it is like the same as blacks fiighting for their civil rights. They ar not being hung from trees, they are not told the will be punished if they look at a white women. No fire hoses are turned on them. They can go to any school they want. Ther have been no gay and straight water fountains to drink from. They have never been told to ride in the back of the bus. You are not the last hired and first fired.

If a child has a different view they are belittled by the teachers and students. They violated my daughters first amendment and her civil rights. Teachers should teach and not indoctrinate.

@ mewayne you need to read more of the Bible to understand it. I thought that once upon a time too, like what on earth is going on here, but the reasons for that was to populate the earth. God has since then made laws and defined what sin is (because He can do that). He was disgusted with the human race so He wiped everyone out (aka the flood & Noah's ark) and He started everything new. He knew he He had to set laws for man because men are indeed sinful and driven by desire and greed.  I agree that people cannot pick and choose the parts of the Bible that they "want" to believe in but times have changed and you have to read God's words in context. The first testaments in Bible are meant for their times but God's laws are still His laws.  And you don't have to "believe" in what the Bible says but it doesn't make it any less true or real!

This so called "pastor" is trying to make a moral equivalence between being Black and being gay. There is nothing in common between the two groups. It is not sinful to be Black (or any other color) and there is no death penalty in Scripture for being Black. There IS a death penalty in the Mosaic Law for male homosexual behavior and there is condemnation in the New Testament for both male and female homosexual behavior. This pastor is speaking against Scripture and therefore does not have the Holy Spirit of God behind his opinions. He is, in essence, a false prophet. Lord, may he be handed over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh so that his spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus.

A number of  school districts have been found to allow real left political pressure and \r\npoli-guilt trips to be forced on students.  Since this rarely makes the lib-leaning media news...they're actually probably more incidents than we're aware of.  In many cases parents have gotten involved and filed suit against superintendents & their districts in opposition to the Liberal indoctrination their child was exposesd to in the classroom. \r\n  \r\nCombine that with teachers--many of whom no longer really teach, but demonstrate and \r\nstrike against the system...and yes--of course American students will fall behind and a huge percentage will fail, drop out and go on the government dole. \r\n  \r\nChicago and their recent tirade against authority is an example----VERY POOR stats in \r\ntheir education system----and most ALL are big supporters of Obama, esp. being in his \r\nhometown. Pressusre mounts against youth....gain their minds....but don't really teach them much of anything of substance....sound familiar?  Germany--late 30's.  \r\n  \r\nPressure indeed has been mounted against children of conservative parents, who also have a right to free thinking and free speech--thanks to our democracy!

There's so much crap in there...if people really lived, according to the bible, what a freakin' world this would be. The ignorance of the times back then, the ignorant men......no one knew anything. So.........to control the people, these men decided to have a form of government. Yes, sorry to enlighten you, but, yes, the bible book was written as a form of government to control the people....the feeble, the weak-minded, the ignorant people. Hey....it still works!

to me, an excellent example of irony would be something along the lines of someone believing that our military as a whole is evil yet voluntarily re-up to serve in it for 10 years. \r\nI also find it rather interesting that one never seems to hear of people lining up to become Korean citizens....not saying it might not be true, but I've never heard of it. I have however heard of people actually breaking down fences to get into the USA though... \r\nSo to be fair, let’s go with another country...One that is at least similar to the USA in respect to day to day life and customs, etc...... like...oh I don't know...let's say Australia...after all they gave up their right to bear arms...why don’t you ask them about their crime rate statistics? Yeah, loaded question, I actually have close family friends that live in Sydney who visit back and forth with us every other year or so that will tell you point blank what a mistake it was to hand them over. Oh yes, I remember arguing with them several years back when it was first happening...and at that time, they were bragging me us about how great it was going to be...it was going to be a much safer place to live....blah blah blah......yeah, well, they have personally admitted to me since how very wrong they were and they only wish they could change it back...FAT CHANCE ON THAT.  \r\nPerhaps you need to move to a better neighborhood if a break in and being robbed by the type of people that are looking for your weapons is that much of a concern....Or maybe, just maybe, rather then have to move to another neighbor every time one gets a little to tough...maybe someone who held on to his/hers would be nice enough to dispatch the piece of scum that was breaking into their home instead of sitting by and letting them get away it . Or maybe being unarmed and being forced to sit there and watch their family get slaughtered in front of them all the time wishing they were armed. Chance of that happening? I'm willing to bet higher then the chances of someone coming into my home and finding and stealing my weapons and fulfilling your scenario. A criminal will get a weapon, legal or not....that is pretty much the definition of criminal, one who breaks the law.. And I for one would rather have it and not need it. So this now brings us full circle as we are back to the punish the all the innocent because of the few guilty that started this thread in the first place.  \r\n‘Hillbilly retard’...really? That is where you want this discussion to end? That is really a shame..but honestly, not surprising in the slightest, that is actually the kicker I was waiting for this whole time. I (and I’m sure many others) knew it was coming eventually. I thank you for not disappointing everyone, but I am surprise it took 2 complete replies before it popped up......... That is pretty much the number one of those liberal ‘go-to lines’ I mentioned earlier. I must say that I am really a little disappointed though, because you didn't call me a racist... I thought that was part of the protocol. After all, it is obvious I am in favor of the right of a citizen having tools...oh sorry...'weapons’..t  ​ hus meaning I am not of the common liberal mind-set which seems to be to get rid of them all (although, in their defense, I know plenty of common sense people who call themselves liberals yet still believe in the right to bear arms)....and as you have pointed out, anyone who is of these beliefs is a ‘redneck hillbilly’ ...and it goes on and on down the line until I’m nothing but a stupid, uneducated, racist pig....oh, I left out bible thumper. As I originally said, I wrote the post for ‘amusement’ ...and I was actually enjoying the exchange, but it obviously got under your skin as proven by the childish banter you spewed in your closing remarks. You actually started out with an impressive retort, for what it was, but you had to lower yourself with your closing remark.

Hey I get it. If the kids say Obama is great then we should all agree. After all kids have so much wisdom about it all. Have you not noticed lately? Kids know it all. And we tell them they should voice their opinion and be their own person. \r\n \r\nHow about this? I say we go back to the old days where kids actually got an education and discipline that helps them reach their full potential when they become adults? Has anyone noticed how stuipid kids are now days when they leave high school? If you dont know what Im talking about ask one a question about our history. THEY DONT KNOW. so how does their vote mean anything? They cant even tell you who takes over when the president and vice president steps down for whatever reason. My generation could not leave the 6th grade without knowing all seats and current holders in congress. Ask our great graduates what the strips in our flag mean. Ask them anything about the last 3 wars we participated in.\r\n \r\nFrankly I dont give a #*$* about the kids vote!!!!!

Sin is Sin, no matter what your opinion. Lets get to the Bible, God created MAN for WOMAN. Men have disobeyed GOD and choose to do it their way as homosexuals,  but this is not what the Word of God says. Gods standards are higher than man standards, therefore we as Christians and believers cannot settle for a lifestyle that is condemned as sin in the Bible. Homosexuality is a Sin, thats why  Gays and Lesbians need  to repent and turn away from sin. I do not hate the person who is gay but I hate the SIN - HOMOSEXUALITY.
