Just because something can never fully be stopped doesn't mean it should be legal.  There will always be rape, murder, arson, etc.  Doesn't mean all those things should be legalized too!

Yes. Absolutely.  Prostitution will never go away, and legalizing it will make it safer for both the prostitutes and their customers.  It can be regulated and taxed, which helps the economy.  There can be health regulation too, with regular checkups required.  Refusing to legalize the "world's oldest profession" is a head-in-the-sand approach.

Crying, this is about taking the guns out of violent gangs hands by dismantling their ability to make money. This is about putting women in a defensible position and about being able to track stds like never before. This is about decreasing the allure of prostitution by removing it from the list of forbidden fruits, and this is about the government making money off stupidity and infidelity. There are 0 downsides. Just look at Denmark, 40% decrease in VIOLENT street crime, not just the loss of prostitution, which wasn't a violent crime, in a short 10 years. Can you really counter argue that with anything other than "morals?"

Well, unfortunately, most kids today have to travel to places like these in order to learn about U.S. History since most of what they learn in school are lies.  Lies about our U.S. Constitution, Civil War, how God (Yeshua) played more than important roles in establishing our freedom of inalienable rights, which were given by Him.\r\n \r\nInstead, kids are forced by sick man made laws to learn about alternative life styles and crap that will never enrich your life or get you a job.

I don't think the person needs to be killed but he needs more than a weekend in jail. Maybe 2 fingers of his or her choosing. Chopping block and hatchet, no anesthesia. I beleive that a couple of punishments will turn the tide against this type of crime.

I am sure they just threw them away after the big art show,  they think oh well we can get more for the next project!     He takes how does he replace???

I think any American that buys one of these cars are traitors. Until we can get Americans working at American companies again, we should purchase American made goods. As long as we let foreign companies push their JUNK here we are going to be at their mercy. Before you buy any more of their JUNK, stop and think "Do I really need that," and if you can get by without it, bank the money you would have spent and look for an American product. It will probably be better built and only slightly more expensive.

Are you really going to stop dead on the freeway to try and save it off your glass? Will you give that cockroach mouth to mouth?\r\nenuf said.

Peter, we're not arguing the age gap. we are arguing getting that drug money out of gang members hands! We are talking about dignifying the profession and making it safe! And no, it removes credibility from the gangs. forbidden fruit is a lot less attractive when it's no longer forbidden. And we are talking about bouncer-defended, indoor institutions where anyone who checks in can be contacted if an employee comes up with an std. It's the ultimate safeguard you ignoramous. No argument apart from relativity of morals can even be brought against legalization, regulation, and taxation of prostitution.

I would tell her she needs to stop the next short bus and beg the driver to take her to a real school. But it's most likely too late, her retarded parents are probably brother and sister, and she's a retard as well.  I hope for her sake there is public assistance in New Zealand because she will never be a normal functioning member of society. Her best bet would be to hook up with a polygamist Mormon family and be the lowest ranking brood mare of the stable.

Oh, Ms. Nguyen, couples had better talk about sex!  People want to act like it will just flow with all the love.  No, it won't.  Women are programmed way different and the modern lifestyle and the two wage earner household has wrought havoc on the matter of intimacy.  Women are taking on more than they did decades ago, and are tired and far more independent, a lot less accomodating.  This should be discussed, the frequency, the variety, the level of desire, etc.  Most men are starving in this department and feel guilty even desiring their wives who see sex as just another demand on thier time and energy.  Men are forced to turn to other means of 'closeness' and or intimacy which brings its own dangers into a marriage or they become depressed feeling unwanted and guitly for even having the desire.  This is so important and should not be overlooked.  This man and most of his buddies can attest to this.  It is parodied on t.v. and in movies, but it is real and important.  Why do you think the pornography industry thrives the way it does.  Talk, sex and be clear and honest, but let the demonstration do most of the talking which to some is a moral issue, but it should not be skipped or taken for granted.

"Get any"? Get any what? This is an example of why it is dehumanizing. You are making the point of using a woman for her "parts". How do you not see the degradation in that? Do you really believe most of these women choose this occupation because it's what they dreamed of becoming when they were little girls? And yes, they were "little girls" at one time and could very well  have been your little girls. Does that make any difference to you? Being your sister, your niece, your grand-daughter? Most prostitutes are streetwalkers - they are not escorts or high-priced call girls. Most enter into prostitution because they were sexually/physically abused as a child. Does this make you feel "like a man" to use one of these women knowing that many have little choice when they sell themselves? Or are you so desperate that you don't even care?

We watch them come & go. I talked to an old man in his eighties. He said it was easy. He sold his home, cars, furniture and hit he road with his wife. You bill everything to your credit card. Pay it off every month. Pull a little vehicle behind. Travel the north in the summer and head south in the winter. His wife died after 12 years but he continues on fishing. Senior park passes discount a lot of money in overnight fees. A week or two in each place and a planned route. He said he always had a million dollar view.

Tabby...awesome story. Whoever decided to take care of these "ducks" should face animal cruelty charges but my guess is, if caught, they will not be held accountable because the town wanted the animals removed. Where I live a Wildlife Officer was shot and killed after stopping a person suspected of poaching deer. In an ironic twist, the park service later decided to dispose of the same deer population on the same day the alleged killer's court appearance made the front page. Rather ironic and a total oversight to report them inches apart if you ask me.

No.  This was no joke.  It is akin (no pun intended against Akin) to the racist "jokes" that people tell and then say theymeant nothing by them.  This was a reflection on what people actually believe.  Once they are found out, they should be expelled.  Period.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  No parental excuses about "boys will be boys."  These people are rapists.  Would you want your daughter to be the victim of something like this?

it is such a shame that this little boy had his friends killed, and hopefully the person or persons who did this will realize how they hurt an innocent child. That may never happen as there are a lot of just mean people who feel it is their right to do whatever they wish to do, no matter the consequences to the innocent. As for the parents, they need to go to the city officials and ask for their understanding and if they can get replacement animals. Some towns are allowing poultry as people have come to rely on the fresh eggs coming from a known source. In this case a possible case could be made that the child could be allowed replacement poultry given his needs as an autistic child. It would be very hard for the parents to explain to any child such a senseless act, and given his special needs just about impossible. It is up to the parents to do what they must with the help of people who understand the needs of this child. If the parents get the okay to get poultry again they must do everything possible to insure the chickens etc are females, no crowing roosters, and that they keep the pens clean and away from neighboring homes. A huge concern of city officials are the noise and smell of chickens that are not kept in clean pens and are allowed to fly, which can be curtailed with wing clipping. I do hope there can be a good solution, but wonder if it wouldn't be better to look into a therapy dog, which seems like a better choice than poultry, which no matter how clean, can carry diseases. just a thought.

People that have a strong faith tend to be happier and they tend to remain married longer, not sure that is a political statement.  However, polls have shown that Democrats tend to consider themselves Spiritual, but are less tied to a certain denomination and there are more athiests and agnostics among Democrats.  This would tend to suggest that for Democrats religion is of less importance than it is for Republicans.  Furthermore, a previous entry stated that Democrats are better educated.  Actually, educators tend to be Democrats, but Republicans tend to be better educated in the general populace.

What Romney is proposing sounds very similar to Reagan's " trickle down economics " where you give the break at the top and magically the middle class benefits with more job creation. Unfortunately, the rich just kept the extra savings. This policy did not work for Reagan and it won't work for Romney.\r\nI'll stand with Big Bird!

I recall how the VW Beetle initially turned the American car industry on its head. When folks were saying the same kind of things - oh it's junk, no one will buy it, etc - young people and people on limited budgets went out and bought them in droves. Why? Because they were a sturdy but basic cars and they were affordable. Soon, it became not only normal, but "cool" to own one. I would not go out now and buy a car for over $25K, which is what current new compact cars now cost. However, I WOULD go and buy a reliable car for local transportation for under $10K. I think a LOT of students who need transportation and have $40K in student loans will buy them as well. As with the original Beetles, the only market resistance is that they ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  Import them and we will buy them!  Let the snobs fork out a small home mortgage for a car. Give us inexpensive basic transport. Remember that even those $25-35K models are being recalled, so don;t tell me BS about "quality."

Tata Motors.\r\n  What will the Oil Companies do to stop it?\r\n It is an auto engine that runs on air. That's right; air not gas or diesel or electric but just the air around ... us. Take a look.\r\n Tata Motors of India has scheduled the Air Car to hit Indian streets by August 2012\r\n The Air Car, developed by ex-Formula One engineer Guy N. For Luxembourg-based MDI, uses compressed air to pu**** engine's pistons and make the car go.\r\n The Air Car, called the "Mini CAT" could cost around 365,757 rupees in India or $8,177 US.\r\n The Mini CAT which is a simple, light urban car, with a tubular chassis, a body of fiberglass that is glued not welded and powered by compressed air. A Microprocessor is used to control all electrical functions of the car. One tiny radio transmitter sends instructions to the lights, turn signals and every other electrical device on the car. Which are not many.\r\n The temperature of the clean air expelled by the exhaust pipe is between 0-15 degrees below zero, which makes it suitable for use by the internal air conditioning system with no need for gases or loss of power.\r\n There are no keys, just an access card which can be read by the car from your pocket. According to the designers, it costs less than 50 rupees (approx. $1.12 US) per 100 KM, that's about a tenth the cost of a car running on gas. It's mileage is about double that of the most advanced electric car, a factor which makes it a perfect choice for city motorists. The car has a top speed of 105 KM per hour or 60 mph and would have a range of around 300 km or 185 miles between refuels. Refilling the car will take place at adapted gas stations with special air compressors. A fill up will only take two to three minutes and costs approximately 100 rupees and the car will be ready to go another 300 kilometers.\r\n This car can also be filled at home with it's on board compressor. It will take 3-4 hours to refill the tank, but it can be done while you sleep. \r\n Because there is no combustion engine, changing the 1 liter of vegetable oil is only necessary every 50,000 KM or 30,000 miles. Due to its simplicity, there is very little maintenance to be done on this car.\r\n This Air Car almost sounds too good to be true. We'll see in August. 2012

Isn't prostitution already legal in Vegas?  Tax it like any other service, implement health inspections, and it becomes a winning situation for all concerned. Here are just some of the immediate benefits to legalized prostitution:  Better control of STDs (savings is less hospital space being used for treatment), keeping that many out of our overwhelmed jails and prisons (very costly), putting some (not all) pimps out of business, and the government makes money.  maybe it won't yield a profit, but the money generated could be used for other purposes.\r\n \r\nIt won't eradicate the illegal side completely, but it could make a big difference.  Prostitution, legal or not, will never just go away, so instead of our government only spending money on trying to arrest, prosecute, and punish, at the very least the savings will be from not using other government resources.

You dimwits for Obama. Every tax ever passed gets paid by people buying. It doesn't matter if you make ten dollars or ten million. Businesses past the cost to the consumer. The Fed govt already taxes gas at 40 cents per gallon, if you raise taxes on gas it shows up in gas and everything else that requires gas to transport. Now lets also force interest rates near zero... this steals money from the seniors that have saved and invested for their future and only helps those who are in debt or want to borrow... Lets print more money. More money devalues money and causes the price of goods to go up, it's called inflation. Sorry, the govt does nothing to help people it only rewards the stupid and lazy. Nothing forces personal responsibility and change like pain. It's not pleasing to say but true. Without hard work and sacrifice there is no appreciation for what one has...

I think so. Then, it could be regulated and taxed!! They could make them have licences that require testing every 3 months.  There's always been this kind of business and if its legalized, it would take a lot of the danger out of it for those who are going to do it anyway. Oh, and I didn't bother to read the article.

Geez, talk about clueless.  Think about it, people, this is obviously intended as a "watch-list" for girls, so they can avoid situations that put them at risk of rape.  It is saying, in effect, don't walk alone, don't leave your windows open, don't take a drink from a guy you just turned down for sex, etc.  It isn't a joke and it isn't a guide for rapists.  It is intended to help the girls put themselves in the mind and perspective of a rapist, so they can see that a situation that seems innocent and normal to them might actually be putting them at risk for being raped.  The part about doing lots of rapes to get better at it seems gratuitous, but it may be intended to convey the message that if a guy has a reputation for "not taking no for an answer" then you should probably not go to his room alone with him.  One would assume that would be automatic, but kids sometimes don't think the way adults do, so maybe you can't be too careful even with warning about the most obvious risk factors.

"If ever the U.S. were to rethink prostitution laws and regulations, they might look something like the law Sweden enacted in 1999. The Kvinnofrid law made it legal to sell sex but not to buy it. That is, prostitutes couldn’t be charged with a crime but their clients would be charged, as would traffickers, pimps and brothel operators. "\r\n \r\nWhat the heck sense does this idiotic law make? So now we're writing inequitable treatment into law (i.e. only the jons get prosecuted?)? Is that what the feminazis and liberal wussy boys' idea of progress is?

Absolutely yes.  It's naive to think that men should be able to suppress their desires if they are unable to attract a woman.  Better to have them pay for the services of a willing professional who is routinely regulated by the state than to commit some sick sex crime with an innocent woman or child.\r\n \r\nStreetwalkers, pimps, addicts, runaways, and predators now service this market, leading to addtional crimes, and the spreading of diseases.  Plus, they tie up the courts, the police and the jails.\r\n \r\nControled prostitution, along with SEVERE penalties for pimps, etc.\r\n \r\nWe need to get smart about this.

Well actually, you are very close.  There is no such thing as the 'love' they portray in Hollywood and in the music videos.\r\n\r\nLove is actually defined as, "The intentional and freely given act of working toward the well being of another."\r\n\r\nBasically, it is a decision.  One interesting biblical quote states, "Love your spouse."  In other words, it is a command that can be acted upon.  Something that you can be advised to do, and then decide to do.\r\n\r\nThose that say, "I want a divorce because I don't love him anymore" have no idea what love is.

I agree with your thought but someone already killed the others and they were fighting city/town officials to keep the animals. In other words, getting more may bring the same result. Rather stupid for the city to complain though, unless they were keeping a rooster or somehow the chickens wandered free. If I were the parents, I'd look into getting the kid something he could keep as a traditional pet. It is possible it would not have the same effect, but you can interact with a dog way more than you can a chicken. People really are the worst creatures on this planet.

I'm not sure I agree with you that her age has nothing to do with it.  Sometimes, older people take a little longer to express themselves.  And, I'm not calling her old, but she isn't a teenager, thank God!  She is younger than me, so I'm not putting her down for being 60.  That is a plus!  Now, I completely disagree with you that Anything can be summed up in about 3 minutes.  Maybe she was summing up in ABOUT three minutes if she had been given that little extra time.  I attended a meeting where traffic light cameras were being discussed.  I never got to speak because I did not know I had to sign in to talk.  However, had I spoken, I could not have said what I wanted in three minutes.  I had intended to point out the fact that corruption exists when ONE person from the police department determines who gets a ticket.  If it were done fairly, I might agree but with the plan they had and still have I think, other police officers, their families, lawyers, judges, commission members, state officials, etc would not get a ticket while the single mother of four working two jobs to survive would get one.  That is simply WRONG!  Traffic tickets for the most part are selective taxation.  I also wanted to mention my disagreement with professional courtesy, which agaiin is wrong.  If a police officer, not on an emergency call with lights and siren activated, violates the law, he or she should be ticketed as any other.  I know it would cause problems withitn the department but I had a suggestion to handle that too.  If a seperale agency to police the police were created, it would pay for itself.  It could start out small, with maybe one office (neitehr city, state nor county) were assigned per county to watch and ticket violating officers, that would eliminated the 'brotherhood' squabbles that would result from ending the professional couttersy.  Also, as I understand, if an officer is ticketed, no points is assigned against his or her license.  Is it any wonder so many people who won't work wish to become police officers?????  Now, what I've said even here could not be adequatedly stated in just three minutes.  ONe last comment.  If you are going to stick with the three minute time frame, even quantum mechanics should be cut off at 180 seconds.  If you extend that, let the lady talk.

The concept we are working under is that no one knows how, where or when a gigantic disaster will occur, but if it happens in America, America will take care of it. That's how it is supposed to work. It is un-American to believe individual states should be left to defend for themselves, just as it is un-American to believe an individual American should be left to defend them self. This concept even has a name. It's called "The United States" of America.

Being in the film industry since 1968, Hollywood is desperate for $$$$$$$$$$. Disney is about the only company left with any money to spend on buying out whoever! The digital age is now in full swing in the movie theaters. Prepare for the end of going to the movies as we know it. Theaters are in worse trouble than Hollywood! They put me out on the street after 25 years of nights, week-ends, and holidays. No thank you's, nothing! My reward was replacement by digital projection & un-employment at age 60. I hope Hollywood goes right down the toilet like TITANIC!

It is always interesting to me how when someone disagrees with President Obama, there is a large contingent of people who will automatically cry racism, but when it's pointed out that 96% of blacks voted for Obama, it doesn't seem to be an issue... \r\nIf all your wonderful ideas were so valid, why didn't Obama make them happen in his first two years when he had a majority in both houses of congress... \r\nIf it makes you feel any better, I would have voted for Condaleeza Rice for any political position, including president.... \r\nBy the way, Abraham Lincoln was a Republican...

Yes. If police lose the ability to calmly resolve situations without always resorting to arresting the public, especially where there is obviously no criminal intent nor  justification for dragging a person to jail, then they increase the likelihood that the public will react with violence in the future to any similar interactions with them, So actually encouraging people to escalate to more unacceptable behaviors.\r\n \r\nFor the public will rapidly learn, police will not use reasonable discretion to resolve conflicts. When an organization put into place to protect the public can't be trusted to do so, then chaos rules and the public will often turn to itself to seek protection. With anger, mistrust and blame focused on the failing police, regardless how many do try to perform their jobs well. The perception is what affects the masses most.

"obiviously" people doesnt like it.\r\nyeah, he SOLD his work, hes allowed because he created it and deserves what he gets! and if thats money then its money, he worked hard for it. so i give props!!\r\nDisney will do a great job!! theres no doubt.\r\nand the most important part is the fact that STAR WARS WILL LIVE ON.\r\nonly true fans will see that, instead of talking more crap.

I don't often post comments to articles like this, but this is a great idea.  All the naysayers and cinematic ideologues will whine and scream, but the connection of these two great names will ensure not only that the Star Wars franchise survives, but thrives.  It also provides George Lucas with the assurance that someone with the same level of committment and focus will take what he has built and strive to make it even greater.  Congratulations to Mr. Lucas and Mr. Iger.  I can't wait to see what they can come up with together.

Don't you Fkn people ever give up.To Soon, To Late, To Much, To Little,To WTF do you want? Michael Brown, You were a Day Late and a Dollar Short with Katrina. Before saying some one was to early you need to look at yourself. An avg Hurricane is 300 mi wide and this one was and still is a 1,000 miles wide, with the pull of the Full Moon and coming in with the Evening Tide. I don't think getting things going the day before is to soon at all. Now you have me Questioning wether you should be incharge of FEMA or not. You sure missed it with Katrina. Where were you this year in New Orleans? Obama had to get your butt moving because you didn't want to move.

The President acted fast because of the election. But Brown is right our Navy Seals were sacrificed.\r\nBenghazi shows how this administration treats our troops. Anyone who is thinking of votting for Obama\r\nshould first read about the slaughter he allowed because he wanted to be friends with Libia and the radical Muslims who he supports. Our Embasies are on American soil but the white house turned there back on our bravest the Navy Seals.

AQUA MAN: \r\nDo you know where Benghazi is? It's half a world away and it takes 20 hours to get there. Please tell me how the president was supposed to stop an attack that was underway from half a world away? Congress (can we say Republicans?) cut funding and reduced the funds needed to provide additional security that was requested by our overseas officials. There are hundreds of American Ambassadors across the world. The government in those countries are supposed to provide security for our people when they are assigned there, like we provide security when their Ambassadors are in the US. Most of those countries resist the USA posting our US Marines in their country. We do have Marines at our foreign Embassies, though. There are soooooooooo many things that you are either unaware of or choose to be ignorant of. Research would be a good place to start.

First Marvel, now Star Wars, next THE WORLD. Will the government please stop this wanna-be monopoly from taking over all my childhood memories? When I think of my childhood, I think of Marvel, Star Wars, videogame companies like Sega and Nintendo, Disney and more but not where they are all ( speaking of Disney, SW and Marvel) under one money-hungry umbrella; they were all unique separate companies. What a catastrophe.  \r\n  \r\nAt least it would've been relatively better if Lucas just handed his company down to his children or someone else who truly shares his vision.  \r\n  \r\nR.I.P. Marvel and Star Wars \r\n(Disney, u shame the memory of Walt).

Been to Italy many times. These homes are not your typical middle-upper middle class home/apartment. My friend's family is from a town about 30 miles NE of Venice called Portogruaro. TRUST me these homes belong to multimillionaires...  ​ .that avoid taxes like the plague! The average college educated kid lives at home with an extended family mama and daddy, etc. and is working on their terminal degree since there are no jobs and forget about selling a house that's why it stays "in the family"!

This is a great time for Disney as a whole, Not only for Star Wars, but The Indiana series. We all love Harrison Ford but the next chapter should have him passing the "torch"  as it were, to His next in line. But "NOW Disney can really that Star Wars to a new level" And really put the Star Wars universe in The theme parks. My Love forever is and alwas has been "Disneyland" But finding room will be a might tough! But (bite my toung) Disney World is where the should Do a Theme park of it's own, like Harry Potter at Univesal Orlando, I mean they do hves a little extra space there ?! only time will tell.

There were ten embassy or consulate attacks during President Bush's term. Dems understand you can't stop insane people from blowing themselves up. Carter, Reagan, both Bush's, Clinton, and Obama have ALL HAD TERRORIST ATTACKS. If stopping these attacks is so easy...how on earth did the rapublicans fail during 9/11. W Bush was in office for seven months, had intelligence supplied by the FBI, and did nothing. Benghazi was a mistake, the president took FULL responsiblity. Will it happen again...an attack by nutty islamists somewhere near our embassies even under Romney...you bet. Politicizing it is just incredibly lame.

I'm not saying what Birdlow did was right, but this needs to be investigated to the extremes. The officers should have their feet held to the fire and have the flames turned up to the maximum.  Their job was to bring this man to justice in a Texas court of law. This could happen to either one of us.  The people of America have a right to know the whole truth as brought forward by a Texas court of law.  What if the good rev has been doing this for years?  What if every seemingly good deed that the rev done ultimately had bad motivations?  What if the good ole rev is a freak hiding masquerading in a preacher's uniform?  What if Mr. Birdlow had never committed a crime in his life?  What if this was the first time Mr. Birdlow had ever done anything wrong?  What if Mr. Birdlow has been the most careful of his duties to God, but he does not wear a preacher uniform?  We needed to know these things.  Birdlow may very well be the victim here.

Braindead repuke nuts. Your leaders warned you about this lyin Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger during the primaries. But you did not listen.\r\nAll pathetic, psychotic, braindead right wing radical cracked teanut dopes should listen to your leaders. They warned you about the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evading draft dodger during the primaries when they were able to tell he truth about this moron. \r\n \r\nLyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, draft dodger, job outsourcer and Etch A Sketch Champion may have vision of going back home to Mexico. \r\n \r\nAll braindead pathetic right wing radical cracked teanuts should listen to your leaders. \r\n \r\nRick the Dick Santarium has brainwashed his followers, the evangelicals and the gay rapist, pedophile catholic priests that lyin' Willardo is a member of an evil cult and is the anti-christ. He also told them that lyin Willardo is the worst person in history to ever run for the presidency, can't be trusted and will destroy our country. Groper Nutquist, the boss of the right wing cracked teanuts and Nut Gingerhead, the criminal lobbyist, totally agreed with the last three assessments. \r\n \r\nSo most of the evangelical sheep will probably stay home on election day or some may even vote for Obama. They are totally scared to death of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch A Sketch champion. \r\n \r\nIf this repuke draft dodger ever became president, and war broke out in the middle east, he will be putting his dog on the top of his car and fleeing to his birthplace in Tijuana and hide in one of his 4 grandmammy's (pappy's side only) outhouses.

Well, wait for it - "Jedi of Waverley Place" is bound to happen...the first Disney Star Wars may be impressive, but unless separated early will become more story fodder to feed the Disney Channel machinery. It needs to buy ideas to stay alive! Episode 4 forever!

Thank you Mitt Romney for yet another LIE that Chrysler was moving all Jeep production to China. Today, the CEO of Chrysler called you out for the liar you are and stated all production will remain in North America. What is wrong with the moral fiber of this man Romney that he must lie so much?

No, calling the police would not land you on the MSN front page lol\r\nAs for fat, I am glad she's taking an active stance and working on it. There are way too many people in the US that are proud of being lazy and fat. \r\nAnd clearly people make fun of her because she doesn't look like a karate champ, and she isn't one to begin with. At least the way we all understand the term - but it's not her fault but rather the writer's mistake.

The WORD...She said: And that is everything. It says it all for us. And you know the biblical reference. You know the gospel reference. The WORD"...CooCoo\r\nAnd Someone said it right, I dont have to go any further on that subject...

I think that's a great idea, since you can always use your contributions for their college fund, if they go, and use your sheltered earnings for your retirement when you reach retirement age. A Roth is always a great way for anything, like an emergency fund or college, etc., since you can always take out what you've put into it, penalty free. You just can't take out the earnings on your investment before your 59 1/2. There are other ways to get some of the earnings out without penalty, before retirement, but I won't get into that for this response.

No, as we approach upcoming Presidential election it was the PERFECT opportunity for Obama to drum up "brownie points" by appearing to be "in control" and "genuinely caring" to the voting public.  Even better, he didn't have to be "cool", sing, have a White House Brewery beer in his hand, or a teleprompter in his face.

Y'all fried the Dixie Chicks for talking bad about Bush (who is the reason we are in this mess to begin with) and now you do the same to Obama. You should be exiled. \r\n You are sad dude!

What gives these people the right to jump all over Mr. Lucas.  You would think that they thought up the ideas and he stole them. Doubt that any one of them would give up the thought of billions of dollars.  You say that only when you don't have it.  "I would NEVER  give up my artistic genius just for a few dollars"  get off it.  Most of them are pathetic losers any way.  Dress up in costumes at every chance they get.  COME ON PEOPLE, GET A LIFE!!!  Or better yet, get a job.  It is only a story, fiction, make believe.

I am looking at all the places that get hit by hurricanes and disasters and wondering why Mitt would ever care about these large liberal areas. Heck take out all those areas and give them nothing that way they can bring his rich neighborhoods into all these Democratic areas. Then he can send the Liberals to cuba or some other country so him and Rush and Hannity can do with this country like they want. Give me a break. If we give these guys another chance to ruin this country right now then shame on us.

Watch out Christians and Catholics. The great satan is lying to you. \r\nThe anti Christ is upon us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \r\nRepent, all you sinners!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ​ !!!!!!!! \r\nThe Mormon book, The Pearl of Great Price, claims that all other Christian groups are "corrupt" and are an "abomination" in God's sight (Joseph Smith, 2:19). The Mormons deny the Trinity and the existence of a literal burning Hell, yet they promote polytheism (many gods), baptism for the dead, and the notion that Jesus and Satan were originally spirit brothers! \r\nThis is what Todd Akin thinks of lyin Willardo, the Mexican Mormon Moron tax evader, bankrupter, job outsourcer, draft dodger and Etch a Sketch Champion.

Don't much care for the guy making the comment I do think his point was that the biggest reason Obama has appeared to be on top of things is pretty much because of his complete and total bungling of Bengazi-gate and his and Bidens ridiculous response to the father of one of the our Americans murdered. Obama coudn't look that father straight in the eyes and give any kind of true and sincere condolences and he couldn't reign in that big mouth moron Biden from so rudely asking that same father "did your son always have balls the size of cueballs"?. He know  he screwed the pooch with his "VIDEO lies", and has NO choice but to show up during this storm if he doesn't want to totally blow any chance he might have of winning the election  I'm sure he'd rather run off to Vegas if he could get away with it!!!! And before any of you bitch, this is my opinion, don't care about your response, and am a Independent voter, not repub or dem!!!

NO!!!!!!! Rules are rules, follow them or stay out. Hand cuffing is to prevent physical outbursts as well as to protect the public and officers involved. In all likelyhood she has no issue wearing cuffs at home for fun. All to often the Police allow situations to get out of hand before cuffing, this was textbook perfect. The best way to stop a problem is to end it before it starts. Don't like the rules in America? Youi have the freedom to leave, I am sure China or Iran would welcome you with open arms.

Let's wait for Romney to win and have another major hurricane and FEMA has no funds to help because Romney cut funds to help pay for the tax breaks for the rich. Has everyone forgotten that Romney suggested cutting fund to FEMA? It's amazing how so many people have selective memories during election time.

Elizabeth Ryan, you are reading controversy where there is none. What I'm saying is that PETA is 100% hypocritical for placing the value of a fish's life above that of a human baby murdered by its physician in the womb of its mother... the one place where it should be the safest.\r\n\r\nFour of Jesus' Disciples were fishermen, and Jesus helped them catch fish before they became Disciples. I'm sure you have eaten fish in your life. How many babies have you dined on? We have, by God's word, dominion over every other creature on the earth... including fish.
