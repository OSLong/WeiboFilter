I don't believe in abortion it's wrong these children could be adopted by someone who can't have children.  I can't believe you people.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Again most people don't know what they are talking about they just BS their way through life.

The KKK were white democrats....not republicans.  It was formed in the south, their was even a democrat senator his name was Robert Byrd, who recently passed away.  He was a prominent member of the democrats and was also a card carrying member of the KKK when he was younger.  The liberal media said all kinds of wonderful things about him but they failed to mention that BIG fact.  He passed away this year and let's not forget that the republicans freed the slaves.  They also had a big hand in the passage of the civil rights act of the 60's, which the democrats of the south wouldn't pass.

I rented a home 23 years ago that had been a meth lab, beautiful home in the suburbs.  I have had people tell me I was "stupid" to not have known it had been a lab.  Six months after moving in I had to have the septic tank pumped, and low and behold, it was full of drug paraphernelia...and the answers began to fall into place.  First, my 10 year old tomcat from NYC began going "nuts",  Next, my calm, pretty little three year old daughter became hyperactive and angry.  And, my pretty, caring 14 year old daughter became a menace to our lives, and acted out in every way imaginable.  I no longer knew my daughters.  My normal, social drinking increased weekly, and then went out of control.  I was on the go 20 hours a day, and I was unmanagable and angry.     I called state authorities about the house and our situation, and I was told to, 1. Burn all of my belongings, and 2. Move.  Single mom, piece of cake.  We are all now older, healthier, and happy, but that time in our lives was a living hell.

It's not that I misunderstood the comparisson, one should not exist! The bible does not say it is a sin to be black. It says sodomy is. But seriously, that is a matter for them to handle on their own spiritually. But there are a lot of us who just do not undersand why they even want to hitch their star to our wagon, when at times we are so completely riviled. They should be thanking GOD that they do not have it like us. That people will not get tired of the word homophobe when some one says a bad thing against them....us when we point it out, we "are playing the race card" . Do they really want to be us?

The spookiest cemeteries I ever visited hold the victims of the Cultural Revolution in China.  You are staggered by the number of names in each: estimates that under the Mao regime close to 100 million Chinese perished as a result of Chairman Mao's decisions and/or proclamations.   Most of the cemetaries have been obliterated to make way for the new China, only 3 or 4 intact ones still exist I think.  What's horrifying is the young Chinese have no open history of what happened and no idea how awful and scary life was there as recent as 40 some years ago.  Many teenagers claim little to no knowledge of the Tiananmen Square Massacre and that was 23 years ago.\r\n\r\nHistory forgotten is history unlearned.  Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  America exports most of its horrors in wars.  China keeps it's horrors at home with bloody revolutions and savage autocracy.

But there is, because the bible has been used to make terrible arguments in the past, and it's making another such argument today. Truth be told, the bible has a lot of horrendous, terrible, and primitive lessons. It even promotes things that are illegal today. Take a look through leviticus. The bible certainly should not be used as a grounding for one's moral compass.

Well, here's that October Surprise we were all anticipating -- Meat Loaf has publicly endorsed a candidate running for higher political office for the first time in his long, storied career, and that candidate is Mitt Romney.  \r\n It would seem that Romney now has the very basic framework of a working band - Ted Nugent on guitar, Meat Loaf and Kid Rock trading vocals. We need to find him a bassist and drummer quickly, although I suppose the Romney campaign could go all Doors on us and have a keyboardist stand in for the bassist.

Finally, somebody said it.  jd(anonymous56) mentioned that Obama is half White.  His mother was White.  Yet, this never seems to be acknowledged.\r\n \r\nRefering to Obama as a White person is every bit as accurate as refering to him as Black.  The reality is that Obama is NOT this nation's first Black president.  He is the first mixed race president.  People, this is not rocket science...\r\n \r\nTo the story:  I really do not think Colin Powell is endorsing Obama (again) due to race.  The man is not that shallow.

It was nice to see the Carole King demos make an appearance, a really charing recording I've been enjoying since June. Some of the numbers featuring drums and very basic band arrangements ("Pleasant Valley Sunday," "Yours Until Tomorrow") reminded me a little bit of Belle and Sebastian - slightly rickety folk-rock with a hint of twee. Except there's nothing twee about King's voice.

If the principal is focusing on changing the dancing, changing the music, and adding more adults to the equation, the school might as well get rid of student dances and let the adults decide how they feel the kids can act. The adults start screaming sexual assault when they see someone touching their kids butt, and then the administration and the parents decide that it would be the best solution to completely take over the situation. What happened to kids want to be kids? The reality is that all of these adults were doing a lot worse things when they were minors. The administration needs to focus on the drinking problem, rather than ruining dances for the whole student body. Dancing is not, and never has been illegal. If the Principal is really more worried about the way kids dance than the kids who are falling over wasted, they don't have their priorities straight. Also, dances are the sole source of income for the student council of the school, and not allowing kids to dance is definitely going to impact the people trying to take leadership in the school. Work with these kids to find a solution. If all you say to the students is no, no, no, they will definitely just plan their own dance elsewhere. And then the problem definitely won't be addressed.

Everybody should know that you can or should post impressive gains when you're going against nothing. Our recovery as a whole has been absolutely poor----nowhere near what a normal recovery should look like. GDP growth, slow and low. Employment, too little, too long. Housing, be years before it returns to anywhere near normal. All the money the fed has poured into the economy---does everyone see huge inflation coming. If you want to hold the course, this is it. Just not good enough. Most folks want more and better for their kids than what they had. Do you see it coming or are we passing massive debt to the next generations? I don't like this administration or it's policies. They're interfering far too much in our free market system. BO, to me, has been lost since day one. This Benghazi business just exemplifies the buck passing. Hillary did it. No, Panetta did it. Everbody but the guy who should have done it----BO.

There are jobs galore in the Williston area of North Dakota. Type in Williston to see jobs.  I am 67 years old, retired but drive school bus part time.  One of our drivers got a Class A license and believe it or not made $125,000 last year driving a salt water truck.  The lowest paying jobs are McDonalds and they pay $15 per hour to start.   If you don't believe me, get in your car and find out for yourself.  The last time I looked, there were over 400 jobs and no takers. \r\n  \r\nGo out there and work this job for a few years until the economy picks up and you will have weathered the storm.  There is no age discrimination out there.  They just need workers.

She won't ever have to shop there (much to her delight, I'm sure).  That said, her husband will go down in history as the man who has given up the most to run for President.  It's estimated he would have made an additional 1.5 billion if he had stayed on at the vulture capitalist Bain corporation.  \r\n\r\nStill, my heart bleeds as much for them as theirs do for the 47%: they'll still be able to console themselves with a measly few hundred million and, of course, Mitt's binders full of women.

Congress needs to get off its backside < You are right but we had moderates in congress then , not now . \r\n \r\nTax cuts work but they need to go hand in hand with an overall policy that encourages confidence in the private sector and the future of our economy.< The private sector has had a decade of tax cuts , with the republican policy for 8 yrs . And the laws your talking about all came out of the best congress money can buy . And the Feds has gave wall streert free money at the fed window . We now have a socialized wall street No risks, the treasury will bailout the wall street banks And they run on no sound investing principals ever since they CONGRESS and Bill Clinton Scrapped the Glass Steagal act.  Talk about socialism .. lol

What was great about the Who singles story had nothing to do with who you got them from and everything to do with your not returning them-- that sense of being overwhelmed and passionate and attached to them was what struck me. \r\n Quick Google search finds an AP photographer named Jean-Jacques Levy who was active from at least the late 40s until at least the late-70s. He definitely spent time in Europe and also had at least some passing knowledge of music. Scroll down this page to see a pic of Charlie Parker by him: http://goo.gl/bK9JG

I love cemeteries - it is the only place where you can find some respect and peace as well, literally! We live ( really ? ) in a modern world thanks to technology, in which people have lost all kinds of respect in the name of modernism. Values are lost and self respect is under siege because money has replaced education. People have ( if they ever had anyway ) lost civil manners. Cemeteries at least make people reflect on the purpose of life, when they find themselves there. But, as soon as they leave ( that place, I mean ) they soon forget what they honestly might have felt - which could it   be an instant of illumination!

@Universal Sage  You were being sarcastic, right?  You said, "Teenagers are well known for not being aroused by having close physical contact with the erotic zones of the opposite sex."  What kind of **** is it that you are trying to feed us here?\r\n\r\nMy parents would have been HORRIFIED if they had known that I was a friggin' nympho at that age.  ****!  I was the reason--okay, maybe me and whoever else in my school district who was very hormonal--for the prohibition of kissing and groping at school events and on school grounds to be put in the books.  How do I know?  Years later as a parent I saw it written in black and white.   Lewd conduct was just too broad of a term back in my day.  The school officials couldn't do squat to me when I was lip-locked outside-yet-leaning on the building.  If my son or daughter were to do what I did in high school they would be in deep doo-doo with the school officials.

I know it's been awhile back but when in the Awesome 70's I attended a lot of concerts and they didn't give a rats **** if you took thier pictures, smoked p**, drank. It was the 70's. Most the time u could even get a back stage pass to party with them. They we're out to make us happy. I know security reasons u can't do that now but these people need to lighten up. It was a camera and a phone and even if there was a picture. Who cares? The amount of money they charge for tickets is crap. Most people can't even even afford to attend them anymore due to the cost. And depending on how close he was it may not even came out. Get a life Mr. Prince..... And everyone else who thinks they  are woth 2 millon dollars. \r\n  \r\nI seen Lynard Skynard/Moody Blues for $10.  2 1/2 hr. concert  Those we're the good ole days.......

I didn't even look at the ad.  I just looked at her and saw a teenie looking, unintelligent, tattooed ignoramus and wondered who would be so bad off to have given her a "first time."  Maybe she isn't talking about real sex.  And she is so young.  Maybe Obama has screwed her for her first time, but not literally.  He has screwed more than 300 million Americans in my way of thinking.  Still, he hasn't done any worse than George, Jr.  And, Romney isn't going to be any better if he wins.  I see nothing positive about this election.  I can't vote for either one with a clear conscience.  But, I am asking all to PLEASE VOTE AGAINST ALL INCUMBENTS on November 6, local to national level.

Elwood, I never stated I cared whether you were waiting on my decision or not. I dont care if you BREATHE or not. You must care about opinion SOMEWHAT because you have tried to talk to me about it twice. I stated my opinion in a rational manner, like an adult, If you cant take it you need to grow the f*ck up.

Reduce the speed limit about 100 yds from the bridge (like a school zone) with clear warning signs.  Then mount 2 laser sensors at the bottom of the bridge pointing outwards at a height of 11' 7".  When the laser sensors are tripped, have crossing gates (like railroad ones) come down to block the appropriate way.\r\n \r\nAnd if that doesn't work, then put two toll boths on either end, and charge any too high truck that wants to go through $50,000 (payable by CC only).

I used to put up signs, both large and small, when working in three separate campaigns for my assemblyman, two for the assembly and one for state senator.  All three campaigns saw vandalism of our signs, often knocked down for miles, defaced or completely removed.  All the while, I NEVER saw our opponents signs treated this way.  Need I say my assemblyman was a Republican?   And we are called the haters.  Go figure.  By the way, it never worked.  My assemblyman won two terms in the assembly and one in the senate and then returned to private life, not running for a second senate term.  His replacement was...another republican.

Get rid of all signs. We don't need signs to tell us who to vote for.

Congress is ok, it's Obama and his job killing policies that they won't vote for. Obama is unwilling to reach across the isle, period. He is a divider, not a uniter. When his terror attack cover-up comes out after the election, he shall be impeached.

So now we are expecting these young adults to act like adults when we still treat them like children? Not a huge fan of grinding anyways, but isnt this a dance for the students? Shouldnt they be able to make their own life decisions and learn from their mistakes? Obviously preventing the illegal activities such as under age drinking and the use of narcotics is less important than instilling these "good" morals? Sounds to me like we are slowly creeping towards turning our public schools into public prisons.
