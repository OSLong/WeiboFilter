cut the red tape-  Now that is mean to say.  I know you are trying to get Charlton Heston's famous line from "The Planet Of The Apes" in, but this is not an appropriate forum for your cheesy one liner.  On a side note; I love that movie and it IS one of my favorite lines in a movie.  I just wish you wouldn't have used it here.

Do away with the Republican Party because they no longer represent the people of this country. They are all out for them selves for power. This is the worst era of Republican politics if one can call it politics. I call it a take over of this country by them. Campaign money is buying the elections from the voters by the Karl Roves & his cronies from Wall Street.

I think race does affect this election, in many ways.  In many more ways than it should.  Race clouds our choice as to who really is best for our country.  It should never have anything to do with race, but whites, blacks, hispanics, and even asians make it about race.\r\n \r\nThis particular study, needs other studies to back it up.  One study saying "it is", will be refuted by the next study that says "it isn't".\r\n \r\nEither way, "it should" never make any difference.  I vote on ideas, nothing else.

In my opinion I say HIP HIP HORRAY to Howard. All the neighbors have shown for their reasons, which can be just a walk away from them if it is so important to see such scenery nearby, is that they like seeing what their neighbors are up to every second of the day. That is not their business. As long as he is not doing anything against the law or against them leave him alone. You should have let him have his little barns to do a hobby he really wants to get into. So now he has a large tall hedge that looks like it is quite trimed nicely and he has his privacy back from alot of neighbors that only want to see what he is up to. They do not want to be friends. JUST NOSEY PEOPLE...Let him keep his lovely hedge. I salute you Howard for the unique way of saving your privacy and sanity.

Romneys are a lot more wealthy than the Obamas ever will be - billions compared to millions.  And, there is not much of the real things you talk about to report on - the republicans bash everything Obama says, but their own candidate for President and VP flip flop and haven;'t given an explanation of what their plans are so what is there to report on.

How is this even close to news?  Some fat @$$ decides to stop being a slob.  Good for him.  He bases it off his avatar....ok, fine.  What "reporter" went out and found this "story" and considers it news.  I read the story thinking there would be some twist....wrong.  Also, dude is not exactly in shape.  He's still flabby, but thinner.  The trick is not allowing yourself to get that way in the first place.  Cheese Puffs are great, but not every day.  The story should have been about this guy getting a girlfriend (or boyfriend....whateve  ​ r) that helped him realize he's a fat slob.  To answer the question for the comment post....I stay in shape simply because I don't want to be a fatty.  It's really not that hard....unless you're Adele.  Nothing can make her appealing.

We of the diverse nation known as the UNITED States of America are fully aware of our history, SKYCOP68 and not the story you choose to tell.  Racism was rampant on both sides of the aisle in the 60s, that is true.  Since then, it has been clear what party the racists have landed in.  Southern Democrats, those who did not wish to support civil rights, clouded their racist leanings as Democrats, but always voted for a Republican president (the South has leaned Republican for years, let us not kid ourselves).  When it was no longer convenient to call themselves Democrat because we elected a black President, these Southern Democrats quickly changed affiliation and gravitated toward the conservative leanings of the Tea Party.  The his-story comes in how folks as yourself choose to tell it.

I think that the ad is pretty clear. He's not from Sorth Dakota, wasn't educated in South Dakota, hasn't worked in South Dakota, hasn't lived in South Dakota, is over-qualified to represent South Dakota and if elected, probably will immediately get bored with being in South Dakota (like some Alaskan governor we all know), and seek a larger office better suited to his ego, background, and experience. And he represents a failed experiment in globalization with all the fancy pants places he has lived throughout the world, an economic experiment that has mauled the American economy. He is probably a firm believer in out-sourcing, in-sourcing and all that H1B visa stuff too.

How about taking responsibility, and being a PARENT. Smoking is bad for your health...try telling them that, instead of relying on someone else to do it for you. Your kids see the same anti-smoking commercials we all see everyday. You may think your children are innocent, and impressionable, and they may be, but they're not stupid.\r\nIf you honestly think Santa smoking a pipe, or drinking a Coke influences your children, YOU ARE AN IDIOT. Kids see SANTA, the spirit of giving, nothing else. \r\nIf you're so worried about Santa being a role model, tell your kids he's NOT real.  You know...because he's not.

No, because woefully ignorant humans far outnumber the people who want to protect these creatures..\r\n \r\nThe answer to this problem:  simple, affordable, easily accessible contraceptives (in conjunction with sex education) so these people who are struggling just to survive aren't driven to kill or capture endangered animals.\r\n \r\nOf course, that'll never happen;.  It's "God's will" that everyone procreate - even if they starve in the process.  Religious nuts of every denomination are responsible for most of the suffering on this planet throughout human history.  God help us.

Yea look at your president when talking Racist pig,, he even slaps his white mother in the face for political gains in the black communities.. Calling America the New black America, If anyone in the white community called it white America, the racist pigs flying the race card would come out of the wood works.. I never even knew what Racist was until I seen it all around the black communities as their way of saying . OH we are so picked on. The Sharp-ten racist pigs the Jessie pigs who cry racist  every little time they want their 5 minutes on the news and media..  this country nothing but separated in all your Racist categories. Sounds exactly like some other racist people who cry race all the time to destroy each other, Muslim countries and ours is on the same path of race wars, ethnic wars because as we see in black neighborhoods, they even kill their own kind, fill them full of their poisons , but of monkeys who should be living in the jungles swinging from trees

Think Romney consciously lies and summarily "forgets" ('Romnesia') in the insulting, mistaken belief  that voters are unable to differentiate between his day to day - "All over the map"- inconsistencies.  Unfortunately for Romney  he simply does not  possess the type of charisma that  President Obama does - the inspirational brand.  Sorry Mitt... you either got it, or you don't  AND lies are a poor substitute ... z00m1

Indeed AlyJohns. How often did she not show up to session? Many reported times. Guess she maybe had to drive the speed limit instead of going 70mph in a 40 many times and never pay her fines. SD is much more than farmers and ranchers. I did all the things she did on the ranch-mow hay, work a few cows-but also obtained a nice degree and am well traveled. She lives in a little bubble. And I am quite tired of her recorded phone call babble disturbing dinner and family time.Someone posted they wish they had her--please take her..

Now days a trip into the woods is like going to your local grocery store, people are everywhere. i would not give up living in alaska for a million dollars.

Tess. Well said, now that we agree, They do pay part of his taxes so therefore do have a say in what he can do on his land that is classified as an "agricultural preserve" he pays less taxes on it, and tax money is used to keep the land pristine. That land classification is also the reason he's being denied to build on it. So his neighbors tax money is used to keep his land pretty and pristine, yeah, I think they are owed the view for their money.

I think TODAY'S Republican Party is full of racists and Christian extremists and anti- government. TODAY'S Republican Party is not the same "Grand Old Party"! \r\n The Grand Old Party did believe in individual civil rights and small government, and freedom of ANY religion and freedom FROM religious persecution. TODAY'S Republican Party suppresses civil rights, based on religious beliefs, they are PRO- Christian, they are anti-environment, against the people and for the corporations and wealthy. They are not for the Republic for which they used to stand. \r\n I think TODAY's Democratic Party is more "republican" than the Republican Party.

The home town girl recently stated that astrology had nothing to do with global warming. I must admit, I totally agree with her on that one.  The home town girl may be great at home but when she actually has to work in the national arena, she is lost.

As an actual resident of SD. Noems IS the biggest joke we've ever sent to DC. She has never stepped foot in college and it shows. She skips meetings for the things she supposedly fights for and then tries to say her spending time with fundraisers is more important then doing her job. She's done nothing for SD and the only things she's proposed never worked because they all were bad!

Rusty, that is simply poor planning and design. They can and should have raised the railroad trestle. That bridge I talked about our city engineers rebuilt, it too is a railroad trestle. And it isn't one of these cruddy 2 line trestles, its a 10 line freight and 2 line regional transport and built almost entirely of stone and they didn't dig it out since drainage is an issue. The simple fact is it is poorly designed.\r\n \r\nThe drivers are 100% at fault for hitting it. If you look at the people that hit the bridge were almost all driving rental trucks, small business box trucks, or campers. These are generally the least experienced of all professional drivers.

(I wonder if she was born in the U.S.???  lol)\r\n\r\n\r\nYo mama is so ugly that when she walks into a bank, they turn off the surveillance cameras.\r\n\r\nYo mama is so ugly that even Rice Krispies won't talk to her! \r\n\r\nAND MY FAVORITE.... Yo mama is so ugly that even Bill Clinton wouldn't sleep with her.\r\n\r\nNo I didn't make this one up, it really was out there and very funny considering the circumstances.....Yo  ​  mama is so ugly that she made Obama lose hope!

How can you at all be impressed with Noems experience? She never went to college, she doesn't know anything outside of the ag business, and has skipped most of those meetings to spend time with fundraisers. If her job was to just make money sure she may have experience, but when it comes to actually DOING something and making a change she falls up very short.

The first 2/3rds of this ad makes it seem like Matt Varilek is a well-traveled, educated, up and coming politician who has delt with both global issues and the DC political spectrum. Meanwhile, the ad showcases Kristi Noem as nothing more than a housewife who has stayed in South Dakota all of her life.  \r\n And for those of your who think that a candidate who has been in South Dakota all of her life is a GOOD thing, well then...might I take the opportunity to tell you that you have no concept of how economics work, how federal (meaning through DC) funding goes to States and how global policies and markets work to affect the US market and US policy makers on a federal level, which in turn, affect us at the State level.  When you're only just stuck in your South Dakota bubble, you really have no one else to have for the $127 million deficit that you're presently running.

I'm surprised that Noem didn't mention that she won the beauty contest for the newcomers to DC since she was the winner. Naturally, she doesn't want to be known as a Washington insider so she pretends she's in-state looking after her constituents.\r\n \r\nHer ads and pictures are ridiculous. She finishes a speech and then tucks her shirt into her blue jeans. Her political pictures show her, gun in hand, out hunting.\r\n \r\nShe forgets to mention that she has sucked millions out of the federal govt. for their family ranch, but once she won the Congressional seat, she just turned the ranch over to her brothers and claims she gets nothing from it. What a gal! Just gives up her share of the family ranch that is heavily subsidized by the same govt. dollars that she doesn't want to be spent.\r\n\r\nHer tea party attitudes are over the top, but she lives in a state that sucks up her political rantings and will vote her back in office without a thought about how she wants spending brought to a halt, except for the things she personally wants subsidized. She's a joke.

YOU are the reason people tend to steer clear of bible bangers Joey, as you are quite talented in the art of talking not only out of BOTH sides of your mouth, but out of your dumb A$$ as well......what did you give up on the bible versus and are now trying comedy?  Here's an idea, stick to posting about what you actually know about, which in your case would be a butt load of nothing, so guess it's been 'real' bumping into you and hope not to ever hear from you again.....

No,  the fact is if Obama wins reelection taxes will raise to unsustainable levels.  The President says that taxes will raise on families earing above $250,000 annualy, the reality is if he wins taxes will raise for families earning more than $50,000 annually.  Obamacare is designed to encourage the reduction of the "level of benefit" in health insurance plans through the use of Taxes and Penalties.\r\n \r\nObama wants the title, power and privilege of the office, he doesn't want to do the work commensurate with the title, power and privilege of the office.\r\n \r\nThe absolute most important issue of this election is the economy.  Romney has the experience, skills and drive to succeed.  Obama is better suited to hosting a talk show.  His friend and Sycophant Oprah Winfrey could make that happen.

The reason he moved there, instead of next door to an oil refinery, City dump or "Gentlemen's Club" ...  could be that he likes the view, maybe the charms of the site or just the fact that its a nice (rich) neighborhood - that should tell you that  you (he)  didn't do it by yourself, its not yours and he made it for you so you'll follow his rules. Now the government, local or national can tell you what you drink and how big it is. \r\n  \r\nNew people come into a rustic neighborhood - where it still has that "small Town" flavor - with kids playing in the streets, Sleepy weekend morings. \r\n  \r\nThen they only want to buy two home sites, tear down both houses, build as house bigger than a Wal* Mart and host parties where 300 - 500 people are using every street in town to walk to the house - then stagger back to their car after partying for 2 days. \r\n  \r\nThats not why those people move there... They were trying to get away from the trash driving El Caminos and tossing beer cans in the front lawn, settng up a gun rang in the back yarrd, pissing in the front yards of the houses next door. \r\n  \r\nHe should have looked at the restrictions .. Before he moved there. I have no sympathy for bores, idiots or Cheese headed Nuevo rich. You can move out of  the Projects, Trailer parks or suburbs - put the things you were running away from; were people just you. Money don't buy class.

The racism in the GOP was the conversation at dinner tonight. I said that with all the folks using  racist remarks came from some "prominent" Republicans. John Sununu, Sarah Palin . Of course anything coming out of Palin's mouth usually just shows her ignorance. As to the rape comments by GOP members is outrageous. When I got on the internet the first story that caught my eye was the one from Wilkerson. It just reinforced my opinion.

Many of the people claiming to be Republican nowadays do have racist leanings.  Just the idea that Republicans feel they have to "Take Back America" is indicative of the fact that Republicans felt someone took away the American that they knew and they want it back.  Some Republicans also believe they have to take back the White House.  Where did the White House go?  Did the black folk come in and wreck the Big House, huh boss? Do we "shuck and jive" too much here in America?  Are we just retarded? These are the words of your leaders, your pundits, your pollsters, and your men and women on the street.   The beauty is, these words are not new.  These are the things that Republicans said when you wanted to take back your schools during bussing and integration.  These are the things that were said in California when white police wanted to take back the streets.  the only things that Republicans don't want to take back are sports and entertainment (unless a white kid in the suburbs wants to listen to Li'l Wayne and then you rally to take back what our kids listen to).  \r\n Those who are considered minorities by these same Republicans are slowly becoming the majority who have voices and can shout out loud that we will make the difference for the future.  So watch out!  You better take back America before it looks like the melting pot it was built to be. Scary, huh?

I watched the video not once but several times and I can see the reasoning behind it. Maybe for most of the people not from the upper Midwest have a hard time to realize the conservative down to earth morals and commitment we have and support. Kristi Noem has real ties to South Dakota when her challenger Matt Varilek has been following his idol Al Gore.

how silly can you get? no one is looking at the view of an orchard they want to knowwhat he is doing in HIS house that HE pays for. IF it were just the next door neighbor I would go for it but the whole town.  i wish my neighbor would tell me what i can and can't put on my 30 year mortgaged property.  people only try to control what you purchase and not other people belongings.  if you take six months to get your long misshaped noses out of other people business you would have six months to try to get yours together and keep it that way. you don't own everything!!!!!!!!!!  ​ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bill Maher is great.  Ugly as all hell, but makes great points with a large side of humor.  I especially like this one, because after all we've seen about Romney, one would have to be effing him to cast a vote for him.  On the other side, if Romney wins, we'll all be getting effed by him.  I like it and the easily offended should be erradicated.

Maybe you should give up your Low I.Q. Atheists myths and find God, maybe then you will not be so angry, miserable, and grumpy all the time.

Sounds like you are saying she has always been smart enough to NOT be brainwashed by Left Wing College professors who have only memorized garbage spouted by their Left Wing professors several years earlier.

Because you are an uninformed voters, as are most on here. As an actual resident of SD i've researched her "work" if you can call it that. She's skipped over 75% of all the meetings during her time. She knows nothing except the ag business, so farmers and that's it. She is lowly educated and when she gives speeches it shows. She's a joke to SD and shouldn't even be there.

She should be punished and she should have to pay back ALL of the money she stole....I'm always astonished when people who can't afford cable, internet and cell phones, feel that these things are owed to them...These are NOT necessities...How was she eligible for that award in the first place???...From the looks of things, she's been too busy stealing to do any "charitable" work.....

"Questionable theories??!!?"  Is there some kind if cocoon surrounding S. Dakota, making it impermeable to the ravages of environmental degradation? Maybe we'd best all move there; sounds positively Utopian!

I can't believe all the people who would choose the less educated leader. Why not get a high school drop out while your at it. Geez, no wonder the world is laughing at USA. Used to be to the place to go, now its a joke. Its better in Europe or better yet Asia that's were Romney and his friends have/will sent/send all their jobs, ha ha.

Aly, I agree with you 100%. It sounds like Steve is also from South Dakota, will vote for Noem, yet is obvlivious to the fact that NORTH Dakota is having the energy boom.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately, the ill-informed and unaware are still allowed to vote and that's how people like Noem get into office.\r\n \r\nGlad she found the time to get her bachelor's degree while she was supposed to be serving in Congress.

The guy lives in a candy a$$ community. It makes no since to deny the man the right to build his barn,  to just to look at his trees.  \r\nSo much for rights, we are taken one right away at time. We have to remain compacent because to the people that runs the candy a$$ communities.
