You've got to be taught to hate and fear;\r\nyou've got to be taught from year to year;\r\nit's got to be drummed in your dear little ear;\r\nyou've got to be carefully taught.\r\n \r\nYou've got to be taught to be afraid\r\nof people whose eyes are oddly made,\r\nand people whose skin is a different shade;\r\nyou've got to be carefully taught.\r\n \r\nYou've got to be taught before it's too late;\r\nbefore you are six, or seven or eight,\r\nto hate all the people your relatives hate;\r\nyou've got to be carefully taught.\r\n \r\nThis song lyric was written 63 years ago by the great Oscar Hammerstein II for the musical, South Pacific and when the show toured the south, there was an uproar. Does anyone really think we fought a Civil War over cotton? We fought it to free human beings and they were worth the effort. Some in the south still call it "the war of aggression that took away their way of life." Slavery. And that's because those misguided people have been "carefully taught." Sadly, they're teaching their children, who will teach their children. Same thing is going on in the ultra conservative Islamic right, they're teaching their children to hate. The line in South Pacific that precedes the song is, "it's not born in you. It happens after you're born." They're talking about prejudice and Oscar Hammerstein was right. We do not come into the world this way. We have to be carefully taught.

hahaha then you dont know republicans very well, I am sure this close to an election they dont want to be taking any chances with their voters to being sympathetic to gay people. and  all it would take in any rally Mr romney holds is for the tea party members who also attend these for one of these gay men to speak out  they would make sure they were tossed. everyone know what the tea party republican feel about any one other than straight whites

Credit ratings are a scam to raise interest rates. If enough people would walk out the door when the loaning institutions say they are going to check the credit score, the banks would learn to avoid them. I can post a credit descrepency on your credit report and you have no recourse except to have me correct it by proving me wrong. Too late damage done.

I don't know if Mitt can do any better or not, but I know Obama has only made things worse.  How intelligent was it to send every taxpayer a whopping $40?  That wasn't enough to buy a bag of groceries, but multiplied by all the taxpayers in America, it surly did add to the deficit.  Right off the bat I knew he was an ecomomic idiot.  I don't particularly like Romney, but I have already cast my early vote for him because we need CHANGE!!!

Take that little knife looking thing on the toe-nail clippers, wedge it up under the ingrown part, pry it up until the whole ingrown part is sticking out above your toe, get some tweezers and grab it before it folds back down, peel it off using the tweezers.  Keep doing that until you have all the pieces that were ingrown peeled off.

raceisium is alive and well, i am a hispanic and i have lived all my life being discriminated against from white people that feel that they are superior to blacks and latinos. if we want tp get ahead in life or at work you have to prove yourself (3) times over  a white person, if you go for a loan to the bank you must have (3) times the amount of collateral. white people feel superior to us. look at this election. it is not that our president is not doing a good job,it is that he is black and the whites can not stand that he has a superior position than a white. yet blacks are superior in sports of all kinds, and latinos are getting ahead in professional positions, latinos are the fast growing population and what do the republicans do is to try to discourage them from voting.white , get used to what is really happening in the world.

It took over 4 years for Obama to show his supposed birth certificate after being asked.  Why did it take him that long?  I am not a computer guru, however, give me 4 years and the expertise that the people working for him has and I bet I could come up with a pretty good forgery.  Ask yourself something else.  He has been asked to show his college papers and passport for several years and he will not show them.  Why the secrecy?  If you have the papers that people want to see, why not show them?  Why cause all these problems?

It is a no-brainer for you because you are not using your brain to see the truth.  Romney is NOT going to get Roe v. Wade repealed.  That will never happen.  Although he does believe that the issue of abortion should be left to the states--not be a Federal issue.  Leaving it to the states does not endanger women in any way.  And it is insane to think that Romney or the GOP in general is somehow going to do anything that would hurt women.  If anything, women will be better off economically than they have been under Obama.  Did you know that Obama actually pays his female employees a lot lower than any other President in recent history?  Obama doesn't care abotut women or their issues--he just gives lip service to get your votes.  If you think Lily Ledbetter was a triumph, then you are very ignorant.  All it did was extend the time people can file discrimination suits.  The biggest beneficiaries will likely be lawyers.

Reply to "STABKOFF" \r\n  \r\nThat's Mr. Idiot to you! \r\n  \r\nWe're still stomping through the Middle East. What credible, tangible evidence did the "Bush Regime" have to justify a full blown war??? \r\nThe "Bush Regime" only had 1 unreliable imformant, who later said he LIED. And he said he had an agenda. \r\n  \r\nWe STILL haven't found any WMDs! \r\n  \r\nIf you want to invade the Middle East, then just do it! I couldn't agree more, just don't lie to us about the motives! If it wasn't for the United States, that oil would still be in the ground. \r\n  \r\nThe only things we did were... \r\n  \r\n1) Destabilize the region.  \r\n    a) When you create a power vacuum, that opens the door for any religious zealot to seize power. It's happened over and over again, country after country. \r\n2) Lose the admiration and respect of the international community. \r\n3) Raise the price of crude oil. \r\n    a)With the West's economies being so dependent on crude oil and the emerging economies of the Near and Far east becoming dependent on the same crude oil. The law of "Supply and Demand" comes into play.  \r\n    b) Why in God's name would we start an un-founded war in that region of the World??? \r\n    c) Any brain-dead idiot should know that if a gnat farts in Texas, the price of crude oil goes up!  \r\n  \r\nThere's always a better way to accomplish our goals. Bullying smaller, weaker countries IS NOT one of them. Covert action to neutralize potential threat is the best. The NYPD could've done that. \r\nThen we could place "Friendlies" in power. \r\n  \r\nThe "Old Days" of military action are long gone!  \r\n  \r\nWith Korea and Viet Nam we fought using "Jungle" and some "Urban Warfare", with the Middle East it's "Desert" and more "Urban Warfare". And ever since World War II, propaganda and covert persuasion has been used to sway the hearts and minds of our emenies.

mg, once again you are either continuing your serial lies or you are brainwashed on wing-nut kool-aid. \r\n  \r\n1) it is difficult to bring back jobs to a country that has no jobs anymore - and that is all bush's fault as you know. \r\n  \r\n2) our net exports to China are up dramatically since obama took office (over 50% increase) and in a down economy.  we make more money off them now and that is increasing.  why would we shoot ourselves in the economic foot just because you don't care for asian people? \r\n  \r\n3) china owns less than 10% of our national debt.  get a grip - we are not beholden to anyone except ourselves. \r\n  \r\n4) obama inherited an economy going to hell in a hand basket and we have seen not only steady employment growth and steady GDP growth, but the stock markets are up over 100% since 2009.  stop the myths, lies, spin and denial and man-up.

And at Vic Derelict58: I was referring to the Redwall series by Brian Jacques, not Bambi.  Try them out, they're great books. They don't get talked about as much but I love them, I recommend these titles in the Redwall series: High Rhulain, Pearls of Lutra, Martin the Warrior, and Mossflower. There's a Redwall t.v series, it's based off of three early books that Brian Jacques wrote. It's not completely accurate to the books although its still great. I'm reading another great series: Watership Down by Richard Adams.

Was it Romney who actually kicked them out or security? Romney doesn't have control over everything. I'm sure he didn't point at these two and have his security escort them out. There must have been a reason other than the fact that they are gay. Who would have known that they were gay to begin with???

Producing a birth certificate is not a constitutional requirement.  There was sufficient evidence without it that Obama was a natural born citizen, if one is not a complete idiot.

Uh - yuh...  I am worried.  In all of my years, I have seen meteorologists' dire warnings not come to fruition, at times.  This is in the back of my mind, of course.  However, the remainder of my mind is freaked right out about what Mother Nature COULD do.  I live in a condominium high-rise where we cannot utilize gas or charcoal grills; when the power is off, so are we.  I wonder whether there will be 911 calls coming from my building; I wonder whether streets will be blocked off, due to downed power lines.  The whole thing is a bad trip, frankly.  To live one's life looking forward to the middle of a week is not productive; is there a choice?

Please excuse my ignorance.  But, aren't we talking about Columbia University and HARVARD here???  Like, Hate, Agree, or Disagree with Obama.  But,  I would imagine that SOMEONE would have exposed the truth about an individual lying about graduating or attending HARVARD.  Let alone claiming to be the president of the Harvard Law Review.  Their school holds high standards, so I would think that it would be embarrassing to the university of someone went this long and was not a legit student.  Let's put aside our differences, just for a moment.  Think about it, if you or I made up a story that we graduated HARVARD law.  And we ran with that let's say for just a month.  Every media outlet would have us for dinner.  TMZ would destroy us.  So, let me understand this correctly.  I am suppose to believe that a previous Senator and PRESIDENT of 4 years, has been lying all these years about attending One of the top Universities on the PLANET !!!!!!  All these years, nothing was exposed.  Nothing ever came out.  Follow me here.  So we are talking since 1988 this guys has been playing the system.  And I know we have heard others lie and play the system before.  BUT, the world did not know of them.  They might have been fake doctors or lawyers in their community.  But, a Senator of the United states ?!?!?  Then The President that has served for almost 4 Years?!?!?!?!   And this is Just now coming to surface????   And We are suppose to believe this.   Now I will be the first to admit.  I respect Donald and Mitt for their business sence.  They are proven smart guys. At least in Business.  in my opinion, running the country is not running a business.  But, I can understand how some may feel it is similar. I see positives and negatives within BOTH parties.   But, come on my fellow american citizens.  This is just silly. If it were that easy, we all would have degrees from Harvard.  I don't believe Harvard would allow their reputation to go down the drain to Hide anything for popularity of a PRESIDENT.  Especially, for someone claiming to hold a presigious honor as the president of their Law Review.   I do not know who sounds more silly.  Is it Mr.Trump for knowingly, causing controversy in a world that lives and dies for it.  Sounds like another PR move.  A possible smart business move, if you consider it does have people talking. And perhaps, it would be the perfect time to release another show or product.  Or maybe WE are the Silly ones for allowing this discussion to control our emotions and get this far.  We are so divided, that we go against our morals to buy into ignorance. Just to prove our team is right.  Politics has turned into football.  I have the burgers on the grill guys, just  bring the beer.   We should just use our common sence and logic to find out the real answer.  Not run 100% on emotional jargon cause we do not like soeone or something. This will probably go over many peoples heads.  But, for the few that may feel what I am saying.  Please, let's try to bring the unity back within our beloved country.  I can dream can't I????   Besides, what do I know?  I'm just a good citizen and tax payer. My prayers are with those less fortunate and preparing for the storm. God bless yall.

That is the most ignorant statement I have ever seen.  The Republican Party (despite the efforts of the hardline "moral majority", which was more like a minority when it came to certain issues, in the 80's) is mostly made up of good people who do not judge others on stupid irrelevant characteristics.  You forget that the GOP was founded on the belief of equality for ALL under the law.  Unlike the left, the right views people as individuals and each individual is to be judged on the content of his or her character.  It is the left that always categorizes people, puts them into boxes and labels them.  The left judges people based on broad labels...which shows their petty prejudices.

BIRTHERS DON'T WANT ANSWERS - THEY WANT TO SPREAD RUMORS!  \r\n\r\nBirthers are stupid - every single one of them - stupid, hateful, and filled to the gills with bluster and bullcr@p.  There is no constitutional requirement for a president to produce ANY birth certificate.  His citizenship has been established beyond reasonable doubt by the announcement of  his birth in two independent newspapers.  Yes, the birthers have "arguments" against those documents.  Yes, their "arguments" are brainless.

Think again,  Romney will repeal Roe v. Wade  (he has said he would and the Supreme Court is sitting different 40 years later) and make abortions illegal except in cases of rape/incest. If a woman is raped and impregnated, she must prove she was raped in order to get an abortion. If the man is charged, it must go through the  courts before it is proven and that takes time. In cases of incest, it must also be proven with DNA and that happens only after birth. Republicans are proposing panels of judges to speed up the process. It is not fearmongering. If he has said he would leave it up to the states, then he has lied...again. In Virginia, a woman must go through an ultra sound which the republicans tried to make it a vaginal probe ultra sound and the Governor was prepared to sign. BUT if he does leave it to the states, there are 27 republican led states that this scenario could be a definite possibility. AND DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT ANY WOMAN WHO BE ABLE TO SAY SHE WAS RAPED AND RECEIVE AN ABORTION WITHOUT PROOF. You are so delusional if you think this can not happen to your loved one.

BERNIE60,,,, I didnt say he banned peoples guns I said he WANTS to ban guns from descent people..Its now a widely reported fact that under the Obama administration,,U.S.  ​  federal agents actively placed over 30,000 fully functional weapons into the hands of Mexican drug gangs,,,,then Its now a widely reported fact that under the Obama administration,,,U.S  ​ . federal agents actively placed over 30,000 fully-functional weapons into the hands of Mexican drug gangs,,,then halted all surveillance and tracking activities of where those weapons were going...Among the firearms sold to the Mexican drug gangs were AK-47s, thousands of pistols and, remarkably,,,.50-caliber rifles which are typically used to disable vehicles or carry out sniper-based assassinations at extremely long ranges (up to two miles)Why would the Obama administration actively send 30,000 sniper rifles, assault weapons and firearms into Mexico even while claiming to follow an anti-gun stance back in the USA?...Precisely such an effort is now underway in the United States, led by the Obama administration which has repeatedly demonstrated itself to be an enemy of the U.S. Constitution and its Bill of Rights.

GOP leadership has helped ensure the people of SD won't connect the dots between global warming and floods and droughts, because they're too smart to get their "knowledge" from the actual scientists and the National Academy of Science when they can get it from political blogs and the Heritage Foundation.  \r\n\r\nGet ready for the new normal: http://www.nasa.gov/  ​ ​​​topics/earth/feat  ​ u​r​e​s/warming-link  ​ s.​ht​ml​\r\n\r\nBut it's all a hoax, because like, you know, liberals are commies and such and NASA , NOAA and all the scientists doing the actual research are frauds - I saw it on FAUX "News" and read in the political blogs who know infinitely more and are infinitely more honest than the actual scientists.

Liberals really do need help... Logic, truth, and rational thought processes always seem to escape them.

, iCarly did the funniest parody of Twilight: It's called Moonlight Twiblood. And Sam is really epic. She sprayed easy cheese on Freddie's face in one episode. She's the coolest sidekick ever.

A highly intelligent discussion of the issues, I see. I think the "Eat ME's" have it though.

"Is teaching kids to use guns smart parenting or a recipe for disaster?" \r\n Hmmm... Well I dunno, maybe you should re-read your own article and answer that question for yourself.

Feel better after spewing your hate?  Just reading the hate-filled liberal posts makes me glad I am a conservative.  MSN ran a SHORT story recently about a study that showed conservatives (Republicans) were more contented and happier than liberals (Democrats).  Posts like yours back up the study.  Your name says it all.

I can't believe the despect shown to both these ladies. Shame on you who did that.  One is our First Lady like it or not; the other is a fine lady, wife, other & grandother like it or not.  Of course, they were supporting breast cancer month both with good reason!  As to Mrs. Romney not hugging people, like Mrs. Obama, this may sound lame, but I understand fully.  She has MS & every touch & hug hurts like heck.  It has been terrible for me, but I have had to back off from hugging everyone but my husband, kids & grandkids.  I was a preacher's wife expected to hug everyone & I just got to where I had to go with pats on the back because of it.  Maybe you should give her the benefit of the doubt before you criticize.  The old walk a mile in her shoes...

This is just the sort of thing that shows even the Republicans feel they can’t win on the issues. So they have to resort to getting Obama out of there using underhanded Lawyer type techniques. Gee Republicans acting like Lawyers, what a shock. This happened during the last election also and look where it got you. The loss of all credibility.  You’re even chasing people away from your own party especially by constantly making what should be social issues into religious issues. Unless you keep up with the times your party will eventually die. As the years go by the voters will be more and more progressive and the old style of thinking people will die off. \r\nIn all reality what both parties need to do is come more to the center. It will never work if an administration is far to the right or far to the left. It will never work if Congress is working against the President out of spite because he’s not in their party. Our country will never survive unless we can find some middle ground.

I'm one of those mis-fits who firmly believes that having a Gun in your home for use in situations like this, is justified. My issue and opposition is with/to those who want to walk around carrying a weapon while sitting in the Coffee shop, rambling around in the Clothing store, seated in a pew in Church, waiting at a crosswalk or Bus Stop, riding public transportation.etc,.................?  You are the Goons who can best be described as "Wishing to boost your Ego". If having the Guns on your side or in your purse, (which I believe you have a right to), offers you and your loved ones protection as you claim, why hasn't ANYONE IN THE COUNTRY, this great land of ours carved out by our forefathers, creators of the Constitution giving us the 2nd ammendment right to "Bear Arms", done ANYTHING to assist these many victims that we read about daily who are being massacred by some "Gunman" in SO MANY LOCATIONS around the country. Where are the stories of the "gun toting bad-*****s" who've come to the rescue, who with their Glocks, and AR's and whatever the hell else, stopped the carnage? THERE ARE NONE!!!! There will NEVER be Any!!!!. If ANYONE of you ever found themselves present during these massacres, and shootings of/at motorists from moving cars, from Highway overpasses, and let's not forget Colombine, Lee Boyd Malvo, the "Dark Night" screening in Colorado, What would be the result? Just more Carnage!!!! \r\n \r\nI'll ask that you give me a reason to believe that carrying a gun in public affords you with protection. \r\nCRIMINALS AND "NUT CASES", along with our Military nor any other opposing faction will NOT ANNOUNCE their intentions beforehand. If ANY of you "Believers" used common sense, you'd REALIZE that the most important ELEMENT of any attack is that of SURPRISE!!!!!!\r\n \r\nKeep brandishing them, polishing them, bragging about them, and showing them off. That's all they're good for unless you want to emulate George Zimmerman.

Wrong, that is NOT what he said at all.  He said that abortion should be up to the states.  He NEVER said he would try to make it illegal,.  He doesn't even want it to be on the Federal level (hence the comment about wanting to repeal Roe v. Wade).  But even if the face of the Supreme Court were changed, it wouldn't make that much of a difference.  We have had times when the court was conservative but Roe v. Wade was not repealed. It is not thta easy.  No, you are delusional.  Nobody would make such a requirement to force someone to testify in front of a panel of  men.  Stupid.   By the way, not every Republican is against early term abortions.  And many of us still aren't.  It was only when it had been pushed by the left (the Progressives who incidentally support eugenics) further and further toward the acceptance of partial birth abortion and legislation that wouldn't do anything to protect babies who survived abortion, that the right started to fight back harder against the whole abortion issue.  The left has gone from saying abortion should be "safe, legal and rare" to saying it should be "commonplace, easy to get under any circumstance and acceptable all the way up until birth".   I have never heard of anyone saying a vaginal probe should be required...that sounds like more lies--especially since that could endanger the fetus.  But what is wrong with requiring an ultra sound?  I think women should be fully informed about what they are doing.  I know it is a hard decision to make in the first place for many women, but should they not be absolutely sure and fully informed as to what they are doing and know the real consequences of their actions?

I have a college degree and I have no problem with people having an education. However, I also know that simply having a degree or even having multiple degrees doesn't mean you're necessarily a good person.\r\n \r\nLook at Varilek's history and you will see that he got his education to further his employment. While that's not a bad thing, you'll notice he was using his degrees to sell carbon credits and lobbying the UN to mandate the market. Carbon credits are a scam, so I believe that Varilek is either not a good person or just gullible. I want my representative to be neither of those.

I really don't understand what the big deal is about coming up with college transcripts, and passport when he has a lot of people to do the work, and it would give some charity $5 million and the joke would be on Trump (unless of course something is irregular about the Presidents credentials).

Michael Meyers, hands down. I'm 66 now and was a lot younger when the never-ending series started. Before that, I loved scarey movies, adored them, watched them all the time. Michael Meyers scared me so darned badly I can barely stand a horror movie now. Thanks, Michael, you creep.
